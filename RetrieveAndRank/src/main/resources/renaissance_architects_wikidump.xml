[[Image:Town Hall in Zamość 2009.JPG|thumb|right|210px|City Hall of Zamość]]
'''Bernardo Morando''', also known as ''Bernardino'' or ''Morandi'' (ca. 1540 - 1600) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[architect]] from the [[Republic of Venice]]. He is notable as the designer of the ''[[new town]]'' of [[Zamość]], modelled on [[Renaissance]] theories of the 'ideal city'.

Born around 1540 in either [[Padua]] or [[Venice]], Morando moved to Poland in 1569, where he started working as an architect. On July 1, 1578 he signed an agreement with [[Jan Zamoyski]], one of the wealthiest men of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] for a project of an ideal city and fortress for the founder. The extreme opulence that Poland's nobility enjoyed during the Renaissance left Poland's elites with not only obscene amounts of money to spend, but also motivated them to find new ways to invest their hefty fortunes away from the grasp of the Royal Treasury. Zamoyski, Great Crown Chancellor and Hetman whose financial empire within the Polish Republic spanned 6400&amp;nbsp;km² with 11 cities and over 200 villages, in addition to the royal lands he controlled of over 17 500&amp;nbsp;km² with 112 cities and 612 villages. Zamoyski's estates functioned as a country within a country, and he decided to found the city of Zamość in order to circumvent royal tariffs and duties while also serving as the capital for his mini-state.

Until 1586 Morando prepared plans of the new city, as well as supervised the erection of first notable monuments, including the [[Lublin]] Gate, [[arsenal]] and Zamoyski's palace. Between 1587 and 1594 he supervised the construction of the Town Hall and the collegiate church, one of the most notable examples of classical [[Renaissance architecture]] north of the [[Alps]]. It was completed by 1598, two years before Morando's death. Aside from the notable projects, throughout his stay in Zamość Morando also supervised the construction of burgher houses and the notable [[Star fort|star-shaped fortifications]]. Zamość was so successful that 11 years after its construction began it had only 26 empty lots left. However, it was not until the 1620s when his successor, [[Andrea dell'Aqua]] completed the fortress. During the following years [[Zamość Academy]] and numerous churches were built.

Apart from the city of Zamość, Morando also prepared plans of construction of two smaller fortified towns: [[Tomaszów Lubelski]] and [[Szarogród]] in [[Podolia]], in what is now [[Ukraine]]. It is also probable that he created the scenery for [[Jan Kochanowski]]'s ''Odprawa posłów greckich'', the first Polish drama staged during Zamoyski's marriage to [[Krystyna Zamoyska|Krystyna née Radziwiłł]].

For his merits to Zamoyski, he was given two large houses in Zamość. Between 1591 and 1593 he was also the mayor of that city and was ennobled. He married certain Katarzyna, with whom he had six children. His successors used the Polish name of ''Morenda'' and used the [[Mora Coat of Arms]] granted to Bernardo Morando. He himself died in Zamość in 1600 and was buried in the collegiate church he built not so long before.

One of his sons, [[Gabriel Morenda]], became a [[Doctorate|doctor]] of science at the [[University of Padua]] and returned to Zamość, where he became the mayor and judge. He was also a professor of mathematics at the Zamość Academy built after plans of his father.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2963">'''Luca Fancelli'''  (c. 1430 &amp;ndash; c. 1502) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[architect]] and [[sculpture|sculptor]].

==Biography==
[[File:Motteggiana-Corte Ghirardina.jpg|thumb|Corte Ghirardina, [[Motteggiana]], constructed by Luca Fancelli.]]
[[File:Torre dell'Orologio1.JPG|thumb|The tower of the Palazzo della Ragione, [[Mantua]], constructed by Luca Fancelli in 1473.]]
Fancelli was born in [[Settignano]], a fraction of [[Florence]].  Much of his life and work is an enigma; what is known for sure is that he trained as a stonecutter and [[stonemason|mason]] and studied under [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].

[[Giorgio Vasari]], the 16th-century Florentine artist and biographer of the artists, is responsible for many doubts pertaining to the authenticity of works attributed to Fancelli. While Fancelli likely designed the [[Palazzo Pitti]], the [[Florence|Florentine]] residence of the [[Medici]]'s friend, and supposed rival, [[Luca Pitti]]; Vasari attributes the design to Brunelleschi, who had died several years before work began. The [[palazzo]] is not in Brunelleschi's style, and considered by many to be by a lesser hand. Fancelli has also been credited also with the design of the [[Tribune (architecture)|tribune]] of [[Annunziata, Florence|SS. Annunziata]] in Florence, but this too is disputed.

In 1450 Fancelli moved to [[Mantua]], where he was employed in the court of Marquis [[Ludovico III of Gonzaga|Ludovico III]]. Mantua under the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]]s was artistic center, employing [[Pisanello]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Perugino]], [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Giulio Romano]], and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]].

At Mantua, Fancelli  became clerk of works and supervisory architect for the churches of San Sebastiano (1460), and [[Sant'Andrea in Mantua|Sant'Andrea]] (1472) while the plans for both churches were drawn by Alberti himself, Fancelli's input was large, especially at the church of Sant'Andrea, which was begun only shortly before Alberti's death.

The Marquess of Mantua [[Federico I of Gonzaga|Federico I]] began work on a new royal palace in the city, and Fancelli received the commission to design a complex of rooms for new palace centred on its [[clock tower]], this wing known as the ''Domus Nova'' (&quot;New House&quot;). Fancelli worked on from 1478 to 1484, but the palace itself remained incomplete until the 17th century.

The final years of Fancelli's life are characteristically enigmatic; he disappears from all written references from 1494.

'''Diego Siloe''' (englized). Really called as: '''Diego de Siloé''' (c. 1495 - 1563) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance architect]] and [[sculptor]], progenitor of the [[Granadan school of sculpture]]. He developed the majority of his work in [[Andalusia]].

==Biography==

Siloe was most likely the son of the Spanish-[[Flanders|Flemish]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] sculptor [[Gil de Siloé]]. He spent the first part of his artistic career (1519–1528) in his birthplace, [[Burgos]], where he worked principally as a sculptor.

The works of de Siloé combine the Italian Renaissance style that he had studied on a visit to [[Naples]] around 1517 with the influences of the Spanish Gothic and of [[Spanish architecture#The architecture of Al-Andalus|Arab architecture in Spain]]. The gilded staircase of the [[Burgos Cathedral]] (1519) is his most important work of this period. Its well-proportioned, round and airy structure with sculptures of [[cherub]]s, coats of arms, and vegetal ornamentation, occupies an entire wall of the cathedral. With this design, Siloe resolved the problem that the Coronería door of the Cathedral, situated in the north arm of the [[transept]], was level with the street but stood several meters above the floor of the Cathedral. The monumental staircase splits into two sections parallel to the back wall, and incorporates architectural elements of the classicist tradition, in the style of the Italian architect [[Donato Bramante]].

[[File:Granada cathedral - nave.jpg|thumb|250px|Nave of the [[Granada Cathedral]].]]
From 1528 until the end of his life, Siloe worked in Granada, above all as an architect. His arrival in the city marks the beginning of classicism in Andalusia. He was commissioned to complete two previously projected projects: the church of the [[Monastery of Saint Jerome (Granada)|Monastery of Saint Jerome]] (burial place of the Fernández family of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], including the tomb of [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]], &quot;El Gran Capitán&quot;) and the [[Granada Cathedral]], which he made into two of the outstanding buildings in the Renaissance style in Spain. The monastery church is distinguished by the immense dome covering its central space, after the fashion of funerary buildings of [[Ancient Rome]]. The [[elevation (view)|elevations]] show references to the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], with large pillars fronted by [[Corinthian column|Corinthian]] half-columns, matching the height of the [[nave]]s, with a second body of supports over the [[entablature]] of the first. Most outstanding is the ''Portada del Perdón'' (&quot;Door of Pardon&quot;, c. 1534) conceived as a great [[triumphal arch]]. Its rich decoration and the energetic and fluid lines and curves of its interior were an early expression of the [[Plateresque]] in Spain.

Among his other most notable projects are the Sacra Capilla de El Salvador del Mundo (&quot;Holy Chapel of the Savior of the World&quot;) in [[Úbeda]], conceived as a burial place for the Cobos family. It has a central nave of three wings, side chapels between [[buttress]]es, and culminates in a circular space covered by a large dome.

Besides the Cathedral of Granada, de Siloe was the primary architect of the [[Almería Cathedral|Almería]], [[Málaga Cathedral|Málaga]] and [[Guadix Cathedral]]s in Spain, [[Guadalajara Cathedral]] in [[Mexico]], and the cathedrals of [[Lima Cathedral|Lima]] and [[Cuzco Cathedral|Cuzco]] in [[Peru]]. He was also the sculptor of a notable tomb in Spain's [[Basque Country (autonomous region)|Basque Country]], the mausoleum of Bishop [[Rodrigo Mercado de Zuazola]], who was president of the chancery of Granada. Carved from white marble, full of grotesque and allegorical scenes, it stands in the chapel of the ''Pietà ''in the Church the Archangel Michael in [[Oñati]].

He died in Granada.

'''Francesco di Giorgio Martini''' (1439 – 1501) was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter of the [[Sienese School]] and a sculptor, as well as being, in [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s terms: ''one of the most interesting [[:Category:Italian architects|later Quattrocento architects]]''&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, ''An Outline of European architecture'' 1963:192.&lt;/ref&gt; and a visionary architectural theorist; as a military engineer he executed architectural designs and sculptural projects and built almost seventy fortifications for the [[Federico III da Montefeltro|Federico da Montefeltro, Count (later Duke) of Urbino]], for whom he was working in the 1470s, building city walls as at [[Iesi]] and early examples of [[Star fort|star-shaped fortifications]].

Born in [[Siena]], he apprenticed as a painter with [[Vecchietta]]. In panels painted for ''[[Cassone|cassoni]]'' he departed from the traditional representations of joyful wedding processions in frieze-like formulas to express visions of ideal, symmetrical, vast and all but empty urban spaces rendered in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]].  
[[Image:La rocca di San Leo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fortress of San Leo]] ]]

He composed an architectural treatise [http://books.google.com/books?id=I4U4IUI2UBEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=francesco+di+giorgio+martini&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ILzDUPOsNO-WyAGnzoHQAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=francesco%20di%20giorgio%20martini&amp;f=false ''Trattato di architettura, ingegneria e arte militare''], the third of the Quattrocento, after [[Leone Battista Alberti]]'s and [[Filarete]]'s; he worked on it for decades and finished sometime after 1482; it circulated in manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., [http://www.palladiancenter.org/predecessors.html Palladio's Literary Predecessors]. The treatise was not printed until 1841, in Turin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Francesco | last= di Giorgio Martini | year=1841| title=''Trattato di Architettura Civile e Militare'' (no figures)| editor = Cesare Saluzzo| pages= | publisher= Tipografia Chirio E Mina, Turin |id= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I4U4IUI2UBEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=francesco+di+giorgio+martini&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ILzDUPOsNO-WyAGnzoHQAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=francesco%20di%20giorgio%20martini&amp;f=false| authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects were well in advance of completed projects at the time, but innovations, for example in staircase planning, running in flights and landings round an open center, or dividing at a landing to return symmetrically on each wall, became part of architectural vocabulary in the following century.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner 1963:281&lt;/ref&gt; The third book is preoccupied with the &quot;ideal&quot; city, constrained within star-shaped polygonal geometries reminiscent of the [[star fort]], whose wedge-shaped [[bastion]]s are said&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'', 4th ed. 1962:43, fig. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; to have been his innovation.

]]
Francesco di Giorgio finished his career as architect in charge of the works at the [[Duomo di Siena]], where his bronze angels are on the high altar and some marble floor mosaics are attributed to his designs. The design of the church of [[San Sebastiano in Vallepiatta]] in Siena is also attributed to him.

Di Giorgio's painting of the &quot;Madonna and Child with 2 Angels&quot; is found at the [[Lowe Art Museum]] in [[Coral Gables]], Florida.

== Biography ==

=== Early Life (1439-1470) ===
Born sometime in 1439 in [[Siena]] to a poultry dealer, Francesco Maurizio di Giorgio di Martino was [[Baptism|baptized]] on September 23, 1439. Not much is known about his youth, except that he is assumed to have been a student of [[Vecchietta]] due to similarities in style between di Giorgio's early paintings and those of the master. The first record of his work as an artist is from 1464, when at age 25 he was paid 12 [[Lira|lire]] for a statue of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Francesco di Giorgio, 1439-1501|last = Weller|first = Allen Stuart|publisher = The University of Chicago Press|year = 1943|isbn =|location = Chicago|pages = 1–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married two times in quick succession when his first wife, Cristofana, died shortly after they were married in 1467. On January 26, 1469 he married Agnese, the daughter of Antonio di Benedetto di Neroccio, and possibly a relative of [[Neroccio di Bartolomeo de' Landi]], with whom di Giorgio shared a studio and an artistic partnership during these years.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Early Work in Siena (1471-1475) ===
Di Giorgio's early years as a professional artist, architect, and engineer were full of a variety of projects. On top of various artistic commissions that he completed during this time, he and another engineer were given a contract by [[Siena]] to work on its [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] and fountain system, with the goal of adding about a third more water to the city's water supply. They were able to enlarge the fountain in the [[Piazza del Campo]] and make other improvements around the city, successfully fulfilling their contract in 1473.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; During this period, di Giorgio was also working with assistants on ''The Coronation of the Virgin'' for the [[Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)]], a large painted [[altarpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wga.hu/html_m/f/francesc/2paintin/6corona.html|title = The Coronation of the Virgin by FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO MARTINI|website = www.wga.hu|access-date = 2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sienese records from 1471 describe an episode in which the artist and nine others broke into the [[Monastery of the Holy Saviour]] outside [[Siena]] and &quot;behaved dishonorably&quot; once inside. They were sentenced to be banished from the city for three months, or to pay a 25 [[Lira|lire]] fine, which di Giorgio paid.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Urbino (1475-1484) ===
[[File:Cortona Santa Maria delle Grazie.jpg|thumb|Santa Maria delle Grazie al Calcinaio, built in 1485 in [[Cortona]]]]
During the mid-1470s, di Giorgio came into the employ of [[Federico da Montefeltro]], Duke of [[Urbino]]. He created multiple artistic works for the Duke, including the bronze [[relief]] ''Deposition from the Cross'' and served as an architect and engineer for the duke during the [[Pazzi conspiracy]]. In the fighting between Italian city-states which followed, di Giorgio constructed a series of great [[fortification]]s for his patron. This source of employment for di Giorgio continued after [[Federico da Montefeltro|da Montefeltro]]'s death with his son the new duke.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Architectural work also came to di Giorgio through his employment with the Duke, including what is probably his most famous building, [[Santa Maria della Grazie al Calcinaio|Santa Maria delle Grazie al Calcinaio]] in [[Cortona]]. The church was challenging to design due to the steep incline of its location, but di Giorgio's skill with engineering and architecture allowed him to design a solid building which still stands.

=== Return to Siena and Later Career (1485-1500) ===
[[File:Siena.Duomo.HighAltar01.jpg|left|thumb|270x270px|[[Altar]] at the [[Siena Cathedral|Opera del Duomo]] in [[Siena]]. The angel candelabras are the work of Francesco di Giorgio.]]
Letters from 1485 reveal that the [[Siena|Sienese]] government wrote to Francesco di Giorgio to request that he return to his native city and embark on the design and construction of public buildings. He did return to the city in 1486 and began receiving an annual salary of 800 [[florin]]s for his position as official city engineer in which he would inspect all engineering projects throughout [[Siena]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Di Giorgio also completed artistic projects for the city, such as the candle-holding angel sculptures which he contributed to the altar at the [[Siena Cathedral|Opera del Duomo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

This time was one of prosperity and popularity for di Giorgio, whose presence and expertise were fought over by the rulers of several city-states, particularly [[Siena]] and [[Urbino]]. His tax documents from 1488 show material wealth as well as familial wealth in the form of six children.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In 1490 he was commissioned by the government of [[Milan]] to produce a model for dome of the [[Milan Cathedral]]. This project led him to journey to the site of the cathedral, where he met [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who had also been hired to consult on the building. Di Giorgio apparently provided useful advice to the constructors of the cathedral, and was paid 100 [[florin]]s for his trouble.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

His expertise as a war engineer came in to play again during the [[Italian War of 1494–98]], when he was in the employ of [[Ferdinand II of Naples]]. He used tunnels and explosives in what is considered the pioneering use of [[Land mine|mining]] technology for warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In 1499 di Giorgio was elected the ''capomaestro'' of the [[Siena Cathedral|Opera del Duomo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Death (1501) ===
Francesco di Giorgio died at the age of 62 outside [[Siena]] in 1501 or early 1502, having retired to the countryside mid-1501. His widow spent most of the rest of her life embroiled in legal battles related to the late architect's estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

'''Louis Métezeau''' (1559 – 18 August 1615) was a [[France|French]] architect.&lt;ref name=Babelon345&gt;Babelon 1996, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Dreux]], [[Eure-et-Loir]] and died in Paris.

He probably undertook the construction of the Grande Galerie of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oG73SCrqtLIUsAJ0jrFAx.;_ylu=X3oDMTE0ZXM3YXFjBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMjYEY29sbwNhYzIEdnRpZANDQTAyNjVfMg--/SIG=1a8c3rdln/EXP=1269628930/**http%3a//www.louvre.fr/llv/musee/detail_repere.jsp%3fCONTENT%253C%253Ecnt_id=10134198673227000%26CURRENT_LLV_PERIODE%253C%253Ecnt_id=10134198673226962%26CURRENT_LLV_CHRONOLOGIE%253C%253Ecnt_id=10134198673226610%26CURRENT_LLV_REPERE%253C%253Ecnt_id=10134198673227000%26FOLDER%253C%253Efolder_id=9852723696500938|title=Reprise des travaux |publisher=[[The Louvre]]|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the eastern section is traditionally attributed to him)&lt;ref&gt;Ballon 1991, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; and conceived the [[Place des Vosges]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Echos&quot;/&gt; His one documented structure is the [[Hôtel d'Angoulême]] (1584).&lt;ref&gt;Ballon 1991, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Métezeau was probably involved in the building of the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] for [[Marie de Medicis]]: she is believed to have sent him to [[Florence]] in 1611 to make drawings of the [[Palazzo Pitti]], which was to be used as a model by the regent's order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=BKZ5FVpmYC8C&amp;pg=PA706 ''The Architecture of the Renaissance'' by Leonardo Benevolo, p.706]; [http://books.google.com/books?id=0eJxj9Xos_UC&amp;pg=PA130 ''The architecture of Paris'' by Andrew Ayers, p.130].

'''Friedrich Sustris''' (born ca. 1540 in [[Padua]]; died 1599 in [[Munich]]) was an Italian-Dutch painter,&lt;ref name=art/&gt; decorator and [[architect]]. He was a son of the artist [[Lambert Sustris]], who worked in Italy.

Sustris got his training from his father Lambert in [[Venice]] and Padua.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&amp;database=ChoiceArtists&amp;search=priref=76100 Frederik Sustris] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1563 to 1567 he was trained by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in [[Florence]], after he had returned from a stay in [[Rome]] in 1560. His first patron was [[Hans Fugger]] who ordered the decoration of the [[Fugger]] mansion in Venice. He was the son-in-law of [[Jan Kraeck]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1522">'''Antonio Abbondi''' generally known as '''Scarpagnino''' (died 1549) was an [[Italy|Italian]] architect of the [[Renaissance]] period, active mainly in [[Venice]].  

Born at [[Grosio]], in [[Valtellina]]. In 1505, he became the superintendent of reconstruction for the [[Fondaco dei Tedeschi]] in [[Venice]]; three years later he was named ''Proveditore del Sale'' (&quot;salt curator&quot;) of the city. 

After a fire destroyed many buildings in the [[Rialto]] on 10 January 1514, he played a role in the reconstruction, competing with Alessandro Leopardi, Giovanni Celeste, and Fra Giovanni Giocondo. Abbondi's designs for the ''Fabbriche Antiche'' were accepted, and the construction was completed by 1522, including the newly created [[Palazzo dei Dieci Savi]]. Also  rebuilt was the church of [[San Giovanni Elemosinario]]. On 6 October 1527 he was named the ''proto-maestro'' for the [[Scuola di San Rocco]], and designed the upper story.

In the late 15th century, Pietro Lombardo sculpted many [[Venice|Venetian]] tombs with the help of his sons.  These tombs included those of [[Dante Alighieri]], Doge [[Pasquale Malipiero]] and [[Pietro Mocenigo]].  He was the architect and chief sculptor for the [[Church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Venice]] (1481–1489) and of [[San Giobbe]] in Venice. He also depicted saints and the Virgin Mary on the walls of several Catholic churches.

Pietro Lombardo is mentioned in line 27 of ''Canto ''XLV by [[Ezra Pound]] as the first in a list of Italian renaissance artists who Pound admired.

He was born in [[Alzano Lombardo]], near [[Bergamo]], and later moved to [[Venice]]. He was a relative of [[Pietro Bon]], and perhaps apprenticed under him.

He designed and helped build various structures including the Venetian [[Palazzo dei Camerlenghi]] (1525–1528) or the [[Portello Gate]] at [[Padua]], built in 1519.

The high altar in the church of [[San Salvador, Venice|San Salvador]] is attributed to him. He also executed the Sant'Anna Chapel in the church of Madonna della Grazia, in the island of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]].

His son Giangiacomo was also an architect and sculptor, who worked with [[Palladio]].

'''Hans Vredeman de Vries''' (1527 – c. 1607) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Renaissance]] architect, painter, and engineer. Vredeman de Vries is known for his publication in 1583 on garden design and his books with many examples on [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]]s (1565) and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] (1604).

== Biography ==
[[File:Hans Vredeman de Vries - Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.tiff|thumb|Christ in the House of Martha and Mary, 1566]]
Born in [[Leeuwarden]] and raised in [[Friesland]], in 1546 Vredeman de Vries went to Amsterdam and [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]]. In 1549 he moved to [[Mechelen]] where the Superior Court was seating. Sebastian, his brother, was the organist in the local church. Vredeman de Vries designed ornaments for merry parades of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. Studying [[Vitruvius]] and [[Sebastiano Serlio]], (translated by his teacher [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]]), he became an internationally known specialist in perspective. He continued his career in [[Antwerp]], where he was appointed city architect and [[fortification]] engineer. After 1585 he fled the city because of the Spanish occupation by [[Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alessandro Farnese]]. Then the Protestants had to leave the city within two years. Vredeman de Vries moved to [[Frankfurt]] and worked in [[Wolfenbüttel]], designing a fortification and a new lay-out of the city for [[Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. After his death the project was cancelled and Hans worked in [[Hamburg]], [[Danzig]] (1592), [[Prague]] (1596) and [[Amsterdam]] (1600). On his trips Vredeman was accompanied by [[Hendrick Aerts]] and his son [[Paul Vredeman de Vries|Paul]], both painters.  His son [[Salomon Vredeman de Vries|Salomon]] was also a painter.

Vredeman de Vries tried to get an appointment at the [[University of Leiden]] in 1604. It is not known when and where Hans Vredeman de Vries died, however, it is recorded that his son Paul was living in Hamburg when he inherited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13220">[[Image:Serlio 5 orders peake.png|thumb|right|Serlio's canon of the 5 orders of architecture.]]

'''Sebastiano Serlio''' (September 6, 1475 &amp;ndash; c. 1554) was an Italian [[Mannerist]] [[architect]], who was part of the Italian team building the [[Château de Fontainebleau|Palace of Fontainebleau]]. Serlio helped canonize the [[classical order]]s of architecture in his influential treatise variously known as ''I sette libri dell'architettura'' (&quot;Seven Books of Architecture&quot;) or ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva'' (&quot;All the works on architecture and perspective&quot;).

==Biography==
Born in [[Bologna]], Serlio went to Rome in 1514, and worked in the atelier of [[Baldassare Peruzzi]], where he stayed until the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527 put all architectural projects on hold for a time.  Like Peruzzi, he began as a painter. He lived in Venice from about 1527 to the early 1540s but left little mark on the city.

[[Image:SerlioChurchFacade.jpg|thumb|right|Serlio's model of church façade of 1537 crystallized a format that lasted into the 18th century.]]

Serlio's model of church façade was a regularized version, cleaned up and made more classical, of the innovative method of providing a facade to a church with a high vaulted nave flanked by low side aisles, providing a classical face to a Gothic form, that was first seen in [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s [[Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence (c. 1458). The idea was in the air in the 1530s: several contemporary churches compete for primacy, but Serlio's woodcut put the concept in every architect's hands. As a civil engineer he designed fortifications.

Serlio's publications, rather than any spectacular executed work, attracted the attention of [[Francis I of France|François I]]. Serlio's career took off when the king invited him to France, to advise on the construction and decoration of the [[Château de Fontainebleau|Château of Fontainebleau]], where a team of Italian designers and craftsmen were assembled (including such luminaries as [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] and [[Benvenuto Cellini]]). Serlio took several private commissions, but the only one that has survived in any recognizable way is the [[Château d'Ancy-le-Franc|Chateau of Ancy-le-Franc]], built about 1546 near Tonnerre in Burgundy. 

Serlio died around 1554 in [[Fontainebleau]], after spending his last years in [[Lyon]].

==Treatise on architecture==
Serlio’s major contribution remained his practical treatise on architecture. Although [[Leon Battista Alberti]] produced the first book-length architectural treatise of the Renaissance (c. 1450, published in 1486),&lt;ref&gt;Alberti 1988, p.xvi,xviii&lt;/ref&gt; it was unillustrated, written in Latin, and designed to appeal as much to learned humanists and potential patrons as to architects and builders. Serlio pioneered the use of high quality illustrations to supplement the text. He wrote in Italian, some of his books being published with parallel texts in Italian and French. His treatise catered explicitly to the needs of architects, builders, and craftsmen.

In the introduction to Book IV, Serlio credits his recently deceased mentor for much of its content: &quot;As for all the pleasant things which you will find in this book, you should give the credit not to me but to my teacher, Baldassare Peruzzi from Siena...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hart &amp; Hicks 1996, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Peruzzi's contribution to the treatise is unknown. &quot;Peruzzi had been the guiding spirit in the detailed study of the remains of antiquity, and he had left his drawings to Serlio. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] and Cellini would give most of the credit for the book to Peruzzi, but more recent writers defend Serlio's part in the study and his good faith in completing the work of his companion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Allardyce Nicoll: &quot;Sebastiano Serlio, 1475-1554&quot; in Hewitt 1958, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

By 1537, when the earliest of his books was published, Serlio had been working on the treatise for at least a decade and had already organized it as a work in seven books. Although Serlio completed all seven projected books, only the first five books were published during his lifetime. The sixth remained in manuscript until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;One manuscript of Book VI is in the Avery Architectural Library, [[Columbia University]]. A second manuscript of Book VI as well as a manuscript of &quot;On Polybius' Castrametation&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Book VIII&quot;) are in the Staatsbibliothek, Munich.&lt;/ref&gt; He composed two additional books, which can be thought of as appendices: the ''Extraordinary Book of Doors'', the last book he saw through the press; and ''On Polybius' Castrametation'', a discussion of ancient Roman military camp design, whose state of completion and intended relation to the other books are both uncertain.

It is not certain what title, if any, Serlio intended for the work as a whole—possibly ''General Rules of Architecture'', as is given on the first-published book, but this soon became attached specifically to that book.&lt;ref&gt;Hart &amp; Hicks 1996, p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; Various collections were known as the ''Five'' or ''Seven Books on Architecture'', depending on their content. Often it is referred to simply as Serlio's ''Architettura'', and several significant editions take the title ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva'' (&quot;All the works on architecture and perspective&quot;); though the first time that all nine existing books (or even all seven numbered books) were in fact published in a single edition was in the 2-volume English translation of 1996-2001.&lt;ref&gt;Hart &amp; Hicks 2001, p. liv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===

Although the books apparently appeared more or less in Serlio's desired publication order, his nominal order provides a distinct flow from general to specific:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Serlio's reader moves from: first, the Euclidean 'heaven' composed of the definitions of geometry comprising point, line and perfect (square) planes; second, the underlying, three-dimensional forms of Nature represented through the theory of perspective; third, the architectural embodiment of perfect form reflected in the Pantheon and the 'idealised' monuments of antiquity; fourth, the rules of the Orders, progressing from Tuscan to Composite, as evidenced in antique ruins and the text of Vitruvius, and the universality of the Orders in composing doors, fireplaces and palace façades; fifth, the use of the Orders in temples of Serlio's invention; sixth, the use of the Orders in house designs (again graded, ascending from hut to palace); concluding at the lowest, seventh stage with 'accidents' or practical problems which the architect might encounter.&lt;ref&gt;Hart &amp; Hicks 1996, p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Significantly, the last few pages of the second book, &quot;On Perspective&quot;, contain three theatrical scenes (comic, tragic, and satiric) and a stage plan and cross section which were highly influential in Renaissance theater.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Aesthetics point of view Serlio is one of the first that use the expression '''fine arts''': &quot;and lately Leo X father and patron of all fine arts and all good artists&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Regole generali della architettura,book IV: &quot;et ultimamente Leone X padre, et protettore di tutte le belle arti, et di tutti i buoni operatori&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
===Influence===

Serlio's volumes were highly influential in France, the Netherlands, and England, as a conveyor of the [[Italian Renaissance]] style, and quickly became available in a variety of languages. His plans and elevations of many Roman buildings provided useful repertory of classical images, often reprinted.

Within five years of its original publication, the Flemish scholar [[Pieter Coecke van Aelst]] published, in Antwerp, adaptations of Book IV in Flemish, German, and French; Serlio considered these unauthorized versions of his work to be inferior forgeries; nevertheless they served as significant vectors in the spread of his influence.&lt;ref&gt;Hart &amp; Hicks 1996, p. xxxii-xxxiii, 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Coecke van Aelst's pupil the Dutch architect and engineer [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] propagated Serlio's style and ornaments north of the Alps. And a Dutch version of Books I-V -- published in Amsterdam in 1606 and based largely on Coecke van Aelst's work in Flemish—served as the basis for the English translation of Books I-V published by [[Robert Peake the elder|Robert Peake]] in London in 1611. Fourth-hand though it was, it remained the most complete English edition of Serlio for almost four centuries. Its example countered the influence of the engravings of [[Antwerp Mannerism]] that were the main inspiration for [[Jacobean architecture]]. Later Serlio's book was in the libraries of Sir [[Christopher Wren]] and John Wood, the entrepreneur who laid out [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. [[Inigo Jones]] possessed Italian editions, which he annotated.&lt;ref&gt;Hart &amp; Hicks 1996, p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books III &amp; IV were published in Spanish in 1552 in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] by Juan de Ayala with the same illustrations as the original Italian editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2301">'''Giovanni Battista Belluzzi''' (1506–1554), also known as '''Giovanni Battista di Bartolomeo Bellucci''' and as '''Il Sanmarino''', was a Sammarinese architect.  He was born in [[San Marino]] on September 27, 1506 and at 18 years of age was sent by his father to [[Bologna]], to learn commerce under Bastiano di Ronco, a merchant of the Guild of Wool. 
After two years, he returned to [[San Marino]], where he set up a wool business of his own.  His first wife, Cagli, died shortly after they were married.  His second wife was the daughter of [[Girolamo Genga]] (1467–1551).  The couple lived with [[Girolamo Genga]], from whom Giovanni learned architecture.  In 1541, his second wife died, leaving Giovanni to raise two sons.  In 1543, Giovanni entered into the service of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], as an engineer.  He designed fortifications for [[Florence]], [[Pistoia]], [[Pisa]] and [[San Miniato]] and also wrote a book on military architecture.  He was wounded in the siege of [[Montalcino]] and was killed by enemy fire in a fortress of Aiuola.

'''Baldassare Tommaso Peruzzi''' (7 March 1481 – 6 January 1536) was an Italian [[architect]] and [[Painting|painter]], born in a small town near [[Siena]] (in Ancaiano, ''frazione'' of [[Sovicille]]) and died in [[Rome]]. He worked for many years with [[Bramante]], [[Raphael]], and later [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Sangallo]] during the erection of  the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]]. He returned to his native Siena after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)]] where he was employed as architect to the Republic. For the Sienese he built new fortifications for the city and designed (though did not build) a remarkable dam on the Bruna River near [[Giuncarico]]. He seems to have moved back to Rome permanently by 1535. 

He was a painter of frescoes in the ''Cappella San Giovanni'' (Chapel of St John the Baptist) in the [[Duomo of Siena]].

His son [[Giovanni Sallustio Peruzzi|Giovanni Sallustio]] was also an architect. Another son, Onorio, learned painting from his father, then became a Dominican priest in the convent of [[Santa Maria Sopra Minerva]] in Rome. He then stopped painting until requested by his superiors at San Romano di Lucca to paint the organ doors of the church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t6BQAAAAcAAJ Memorie dei più insigni pittori, scultori e architetti Dominicani], Volume 1, by P. Vincenzo Marchese, pages 337-337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and decoration of Villa Farnesina==

Almost all art critics ascribe the design of the Villa Chigi in Rome, now known more commonly as the [[Villa Farnesina]], to Peruzzi. In this villa, two wings branch off from a central hall with a simple arrangement of [[pilaster]]s, and a decorative [[frieze]] on the exterior of the building [http://www.lincei.it/informazioni/visita/img/FARNESINA.GRANDE.jpg]. Some of the frescoed paintings which adorn the interior rooms are by Peruzzi.  One example is the Sala delle Prospettive, in which Peruzzi revived the perspective schemers of [[Melozzo da Forli]] and [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], possibly under the influence of both.  The walls of the room are painted so that when one stands toward the left, one has the illusion that one is standing in an open-air terrace, lined by pillars, looking out over a continuous landscape.  The decoration of the façade, the work of Peruzzi, has almost entirely vanished, but it is documented by an anonymous French artist in a drawing, now held by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/all/villa_farnesina_north_fa_ade_with_ornamental_detailing_anonymous_french_16th_century/objectview_enlarge.aspx?page=36&amp;sort=4&amp;sortdir=desc&amp;keyword=&amp;fp=29&amp;dd1=0&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=0&amp;OID=90028601&amp;vT=1]. To decorate this villa on the [[Tiber]] many artists were employed, and just as the style of the villa in no wise recalls the old castellated type of country-house, so the paintings in harmony with the pleasure-loving spirits of the time were thoroughly antique and uninspired by [[Christian]] ideas. [[Raphael]] designed the composition of the story of [[Cupid and Psyche|Amor and Psyche]] as a continuation of the [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]]. On a plate-glass vault Peruzzi painted the [[heaven|firmament]], with the [[zodiac]]al signs, the [[planet]]s, and other heavenly bodies. The interior room has a striking use of illusionistic perspective [http://www.lincei.it/informazioni/visita/img/SALA.PROSPETTIVE.jpg]

==Other work==
[[Image:Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne.jpg|thumb|150px|Façade of Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne.]]
Peruzzi had produced a mosaic ceiling for the church of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome]]; the mosaic depicts the Saviour. Other paintings ascribed to him are to be found in [[Sant'Onofrio (Rome)|Sant'Onofrio]] and [[San Pietro in Montorio]]. That Peruzzi improved as time went on is evident in his later works, e.g., the &quot;Madonna with Saints&quot; in [[Santa Maria della Pace]] at Rome, and the fresco of ''Augustus and the Tiburtine Sibyl'' in [[Santa Maria in Portico a Fontegiusta]] at Siena. As our master interested himself in the decorative art also, he exercised a strong influence in this direction, not only by his own decorative paintings but also by furnishing designs for craftsmen of various kinds. While primarily being an architect, of his great loves was drawing and he was especially well known for his extraordinary studies of antique buildings, as seen in The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine (1502–1503) in the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oberlin.edu/amam/documents/3_Peruzzi_MysticMarriageOfSaintCatherine.pdf The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine, 1502-1503: Baldassare Peruzzi (Italian, 1481-1573):Tempura and Oil on panel, transferred to masonite:Diameter: 24 ½ in. (62.2 cm)], CLASSROOM RESOURCE SHEET, Allen Memorial Art Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

His final architectural masterpiece, the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]] (1535) located on the modern day Corso Vittorio Emanuele, is well known for its curving facade, ingenious planning, and architecturally rich interior. The exterior details display a [[mannerism|Mannerist]]-style.

He made significant but unspecified contributions to what would become the ''Seven Books of Architecture'', published in installments after Peruzzi's death by his pupil, [[Sebastiano Serlio]].

'''Giorgio Vasari''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒordʒo vaˈzaːri|lang}}; 30 July 1511 – 27 June 1574) was an [[List of Italian painters|Italian painter]], [[Architecture of Italy|architect]], writer, and historian, most famous today for his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'', considered the ideological foundation of [[art history|art-historical]] writing.

==Early life==
Vasari was born in [[Arezzo]], Tuscany.&lt;ref name=gaunt/&gt; Recommended at an early age by his cousin [[Luca Signorelli]], he became a pupil of [[Guglielmo da Marsiglia]], a skillful painter of [[stained glass]]. Sent to [[Florence]] at the age of sixteen by Cardinal Silvio Passerini, he joined the circle of [[Andrea del Sarto]] and his pupils [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and [[Jacopo Pontormo]] where his humanist education was encouraged. He was befriended by [[Michelangelo]] whose painting style would influence his own.

==Painting==
[[File:Giorgio Vasari - Six Tuscan Poets - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| Giorgio Vasari, ''Six Tuscan Poets'', c. 1544. From left to right: Marsilio Ficino, Cristoforo Landino, Francesco Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Dante Alighieri and Guido Cavalcanti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.artsmia.org/art/1850/six-tuscan-poets-giorgio-vasari|title=Six Tuscan Poets, Giorgio Vasari|publisher=Minneapolis Institute of Art|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Giorgio Vasari - The Garden of Gethsemane - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Giorgio Vasari, The Garden of Gethsemane]]  
In 1529, he visited Rome where he studied the works of [[Raphael]] and other artists of the Roman [[High Renaissance]]. Vasari's own [[Mannerist]] paintings were more admired in his lifetime than afterwards. In 1547 he completed the hall of the chancery in Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome with frescoes that received the name [[Sala dei Cento Giorni]]. He was consistently employed by members of the [[Medici family]] in [[Florence]] and Rome, and worked in [[Naples]], Arezzo and other places. Many of his pictures still exist, the most important being the wall and ceiling paintings in the Sala di Cosimo I in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in Florence, where he and his assistants were at work from 1555, and the frescoes begun by him inside the vast [[cupola]] of the [[Santa Maria del Fiore|Duomo]] were completed by [[Federico Zuccari]] and with the help of [[Giovanni Balducci]]. He also helped to organize the decoration of the [[Studiolo of Francesco I (Palazzo Vecchio)|Studiolo]], now reassembled in the Palazzo Vecchio. One of his pupils was [[Sebastiano Flori]].

==Architecture==
Aside from his career as a painter, Vasari was also successful as an architect. His [[loggia]] of the [[Uffizi|Palazzo degli Uffizi]] by the [[Arno]] opens up the vista at the far end of its long narrow courtyard, a unique piece of urban planning that functions as a public piazza, and which, if considered as a short street, is unique as a Renaissance street with a unified architectural treatment. The view of the Loggia from the Arno reveals that, with the [[Vasari Corridor]], it is one of very few structures that line the river which are open to the river itself and appear to embrace the riverside environment.

[[File:Firenze - Uffizi.jpg|thumb|right|The Uffizi Loggia]]
In Florence, Vasari also built the long passage, now called Vasari Corridor, which connects the Uffizi with the [[Palazzo Pitti]] on the other side of the river. The enclosed corridor passes alongside the River Arno on an arcade, crosses the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and winds around the exterior of several buildings.

He also renovated the medieval churches of [[Santa Maria Novella]] and [[Basilica di Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]. At both he removed the original [[rood screen]] and loft, and remodelled the retro-[[choir]]s in the Mannerist taste of his time.  In Santa Croce, he was responsible for the painting of ''The Adoration of the Magi'' which was commissioned by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1566 and completed in February 1567.  It was recently restored, before being put on exhibition in 2011 in Rome and in Naples.  Eventually it is planned to return it to the church of Santa Croce in [[Bosco Marengo]] (Province of Alessandria, Piedmont).

In 1562 Vasari built the octagonal dome on the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Humility]] in [[Pistoia]], an important example of [[high Renaissance]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian Travelers Guide to Italy'' by David Bershad, Carolina Mangone, Irving Hexham 2001 ISBN 0-310-22573-6-page [https://books.google.com/books?id=KRkU9ocQr2oC&amp;pg=PA139]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, Vasari worked with [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] and [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] at [[Pope Julius III]]'s [[Villa Giulia]].

==''The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects''==
{{main|Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects}}
[[File:Vite.jpg|thumb|A cover of the ''Lives'']]
Often called &quot;the first art historian&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/vasarig.htm Vasari, Giorgio.] Dictionary of Art Historians, 2013. Retrieved 26 May 2013. [http://www.webcitation.org/6GtHONdEV Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari invented the genre of the encyclopedia of artistic biographies with his ''Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori'' (''[[Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''), dedicated to Grand Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], which was first published in 1550. He was the first to use the term &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; (''rinascita'') in print, though an awareness of the ongoing &quot;rebirth&quot; in the arts had been in the air since the time of [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]], and he was responsible for our use of the term [[Gothic Art]], though he only used the word Goth which he associated with the &quot;barbaric&quot; German style. The ''Lives'' also included a novel treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio. (1907) ''[https://archive.org/details/vasariontechniqu1907vasa Vasari on technique: being the introduction to the three arts of design, architecture, sculpture and painting, prefixed to the Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects]''. [[Gerard Baldwin Brown|G. Baldwin Brown]] Ed. Louisa S. Maclehose Trans. London: Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, with the addition of woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural).

The work has a consistent and notorious bias in favour of [[Florence, Italy|Florentines]], and tends to attribute to them all the developments in Renaissance art – for example, the invention of [[engraving]]. Venetian art in particular (along with arts from other parts of Europe), is systematically ignored in the first edition. Between the first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and while the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including [[Titian]]) it did so without achieving a neutral point of view.

Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, while others are inventions or generic fictions, such as the tale of young [[Giotto]] painting a fly on the surface of a painting by [[Cimabue]] that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles. With a few exceptions, however, Vasari's aesthetic judgement was acute and unbiased.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and those of the immediate past. Modern criticism – with new materials opened up by research – has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions.

Vasari includes a sketch of his own biography at the end of the ''Lives'', and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]].

According to the historian Richard Goldthwaite,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Goldthwaite, ''The Economy of Renaissance Florence'', 2009, pp. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari was one of the earliest authors to use the term &quot;competition&quot; (or &quot;concorrenza&quot; in Italian) in its economic sense. He used it repeatedly, and stressed the concept in his introduction to the life of [[Pietro Perugino]], in explaining the reasons for Florentine artistic preeminence. In Vasari's view, Florentine artists excelled because they were hungry, and they were hungry because their fierce competition amongst themselves for commissions kept them so.  Competition, he said, is &quot;one of the nourishments that maintain them.&quot; 

==Social standing==

Vasari enjoyed high repute during his lifetime and amassed a considerable fortune. In 1547, he built himself a fine house in [[Arezzo]] (now a museum honouring him), and decorated its walls and vaults with paintings. He was elected to the municipal council or priori of his native town, and finally rose to the supreme office of [[gonfalonier]]e.

In 1563, he helped found the Florence [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno|''Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno'']], with the Grand Duke and Michelangelo as ''capi'' of the institution and 36 artists chosen as members.

'''Juan Bautista de Toledo''' (c. 1515 - 19 May 1567) was Spanish architect. He was educated in Italy, in the Italian High Renaissance. As many Italian renaissance architects, he had experience in both architecture and military and civil [[public works]]. Born, either in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] or in [[Madrid]] around 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Bautista de Toledo y Felipe II: la implantación del clasicismo en España | Rivera Blanco, José Javier | Universidad de Valladolid 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died on 19 May 1567 in Madrid, and was buried in Madrid in the choir of the primitive “Convento de Santo Tomás, Iglesia de la Santa Cruz”.

==Career==
Perhaps he started his career in architecture in Rome, between 1534 and 1541, working for [[Michelangelo]] and [[Pope Paul III]] (Alessandro Farnese), completing the facade and courtyard of [[Palazzo Farnese]]. Then, possibly, he continues his training in the construction site of St. Peter's, under the direction of [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]]. Another hypothesis is that he worked for [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] in both Fortaleza da Basso, [[Florence]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Architectural Drawing]]s of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and His Circle: Fortifications, Machines and Festival Architecture | Vol 1 | Christoph L. Frommel, Adams Nicholas (Eds.) | February 1994 |The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St. Peter’s Basilica]] of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Bautista de Toledo y Juan de Herrera | Secundino de Zuazo Ugalde | Fundación Pastor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Bautista de Toledo, an enigmatic and puzzling personality, was known in Florence&lt;ref&gt;Unpublished paper of Agustin Bustamante Garcia on Juan Bautista de Toledo at Florence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Architectural Drawings of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and His Circle: Fortifications, Machines and Festival Architecture | Vol 1 | Christoph L. Frommel, Nicholas Adams (Eds.) | February 1994 |The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Rome as '''Giovanni Battista de Alfonsis'''. However, in Naples and Madrid, he was identified as '''Juan Bautista de Toledo''': both Spanish architects had the same hand writing.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Bautista de Toledo y Felipe II: la implantación del clasicismo en España | Rivera Blanco, José Javier | 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps, his true name was '''Juan Bautista de Toledo Alfonsis'''.

== El Escorial ==
[[Image:ElEscorial distant view2.jpg|thumb|300px|Toledo made the plans for the [[El Escorial|Monastery of El Escorial]]]]
In [[El Escorial]], his most significant job, on 23 April 1563, in the ceremony of the masonry stone ([[cornerstone]]), [[Juan de Herrera]] wrote over the visible side of the first stone, &quot;'''JOANNES BAPTISTA ARCHITECTUS MAJOR. APRILES 23'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Las tres primeras piedras del Monasterio de San Lorenzo el Real de El Escorial | Pedro Martín Gómez | Homenaje a Juan de Herrera | Fundación Obra Pía &quot;Juan de Herrera | Santander | 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In the other sides of the first stone, the inscriptions are: in one side, &quot;'''DEUS OPTIMUS MAXIMUS OPERO ASPICIAT'''&quot;; and in the other side, &quot;'''PHILIPUS HISPANIARUM REX A FUNDAMENTIS ERIXIR −1563'''&quot;: &quot;En 23 dias del mes de abril, dia de San Jorge mártir, deste año de 1563 se puso la primera piedra del monasterio en el cimiento del reflectorio, debajo de la silla del prior, que es en la bodega, debajo del dicho reflectorio, la cual piedra es cuadrada y está escrita por todas partes, que da a entender quien es el fundador, y quien es el arquitecto y el día y año en que se pone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Memorias | Fray Juan de San Gerónimo | Colección de Documentos Inéditos para la Historia de España, tomo VII | Madrid | 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 1546 Pope [[Paul III]] appointed the Spaniard Joannes Baptista, Deputy Coordinator Architect for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] of Rome: &quot;Similis deputatio pro Joanne Bapta. Hispano&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright in the Renaissance: Prints and the Privilegio in Sixteenth-Century Venice and Rome | Christopher L.C.E. Witcombe | 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 February 1947 “[[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]] (…) informed the Florentine mason master Niccolo that he was to follow the orders of Giovanni Battista de Alfonsis, his personal choice as successor of [[Antonio Labacco|Labacco]](…)”.&lt;ref&gt;Michelangelo at St. Peter's: The Arberino Correspondence | Howard Saalman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Paul III]], his [[patronage|patron]], died in 1549, on 20 September 1548,&lt;ref&gt;Juan Bautista de Toledo y Felipe II: la implantación del clasicismo en España | Rivera Blanco, José Javier | Universidad de Valladolid 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; summoned by the [[Viceroy]] [[Pedro Álvarez de Toledo]] Giovanni Battista de Alfonsis went to [[Naples]] to work under the name of &quot;Juan Bautista de Toledo&quot; in the position of &quot;Maestro Mayor de Obras Reales en el Reino de Nápoles&quot;.

In [[Naples]], he designed and rebuilt many buildings, including: the Strada di Toledo (since 1870 called Strada di Roma), the church of St. Giacomo degli Spagnuoli; the square bastions to the [[Castel Nuovo|Castello Nuovo]]; a large palazzo at [[Posillipo]], the fortress of [[Sant'Elmo]]; and several fountains.

In 1559, he was appointed Maestro Mayor de Obras Reales (maily in [[Madrid]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and summoned back to [[Madrid]]. His yearly salary was at first no more than 220 [[ducats]], because Philip's policy, with his Spanish artists at least, was to give them moderate allowances until he had tested their abilities.

He restored the Alcazar de Madrid, [[Alcazar of Toledo|Alcazar de Toledo]] and Convento de los Jerónimos de Madrid. He designed the frontage of the church de las [[Convent of Las Descalzas Reales|Descalzas Reales]] He also performed architectural and public works in [[Casa de Campo]] de Madrid, Casa Real de Aceca and [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez|Palacio de Aranjuez]].

In 1561, he was appointed &quot;Arquitecto Real&quot; responsible for the town planning of El Escorial: Monastery, El Escorial village and La Granjilla. In other words, “El Escurial (the name of [[El Escorial, Madrid|El Escorial]] (village) in the 16th century) Monastery and Site: the inscription of El Escorial in the World Heritage List of UNESCO.

He supervised architectural and public works in [[El Escorial, Madrid|El Escorial]] (village), the surroundings of [[El Escorial]] (monastery) and [[La Granjilla de La Fresneda]] until his death in 1567. The [[El Escorial|Monastery]] was finished by [[Juan de Herrera]] in 1584.

The main public works in the town planning of [[El Escorial, Madrid|El Escorial]] were the Aqueduct and Ponds of La Granjilla, the Aqueduct to the Monastery and the two streets joining El Escorial (village) to the Monastery and La Granjilla. El Escorial of Juan Bautista de Toledo and Juan de Herrera is an example of territorial development based on exclusive aesthetic values of global significance.

Furthermore, he designed the overall outline of [[La Granjilla de La Fresneda]]. The project was finished with the collaboration of architects, [[Gaspar de Vega]] and  [[Juan de Herrera]]; gardener [[fray Marcos de Cardona]]; Furthermore, Dutch dams experts [[Petre Janson]] and Spond. Still to be investigated the participation of [[Juanelo Turriano]], Hydraulic Engineer of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].

'''Andrés de Vandelvira''' (1509&amp;ndash;1575) was a Spanish architect, active mainly in [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Uclés]], [[Baeza]], and [[Úbeda]] during the [[Renaissance]]. He was born in [[Alcaraz]], in the province of [[Province of Albacete|Albacete]] and died in [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]].

The church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción in [[Villacarrillo]] was one of his first works in Jaén. 
Among his most notable works is the ''Chapel of the Savior'' in [[Úbeda]], based on a project by [[Diego de Siloé]], and commissioned by [[Francisco de los Cobos]]. The Chapel is located on the [[Vazquez de Molina Square]] next to the Dean Ortega Palace and the [[Vázquez de Molina Palace]], both designed by Vandelvira. He completed the Chapel of the Benavides in the convent of San Francisco of [[Baeza]]. He also helped complete the cathedral de Baeza, the Convent of Santo Domingo de La Guardia in Jaén, and the Hospital de Santiago in Úbeda. His masterpiece is considered the [[Jaén Cathedral]].

One of his sons, [[Alonso de Vandelvira]], published a book on stone-cutting, entitled &quot;Libro de cortes de piedra&quot;.

'''Bartolommeo Berrecci''' (1480 [[Florence]], [[Italy]] - 1537 [[Kraków]], [[Poland]]) was an Italian renaissance architect, who spent most of his career in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/bartolomeo-berecci&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and career in Poland==

He learned architecture in Florence, first through apprenticeship with his father who was also an architect. He was then probably taught by [[Andrea Ferrucci]], his father's fellow Florentine architect. He moved to [[Poland]] in 1516 at the invitation of the bishop [[Jan Łaski]] to take over the work of rebuilding the [[Wawel]] Royal Castle in [[Kraków]] after the death of [[Francesco Fiorentino]], working with [[Benedykt from Sandomierz]]. The castle had burnt down in 1499, and the rebuilding was commissioned by [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]]. He also took over Florentino's workship, with the artists Bernardino di Gianotis, Giovanni Cini from [[Siena]], Mikołaj Castiglione, and five members of the Soli family.&lt;ref&gt;http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/bartolomeo-berecci&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked in [[Kraków]], [[Niepołomice]], [[Poznań]], [[Tarnów]] and most likely in [[Vilnius]] where the [[Royal Palace of Lithuania]] was reconstructed. He became very rich in Poland, owning a number of houses in Kraków and a brickyard. He was murdered by another jealous Italian artist in Kraków and was buried in the Corpus Christi Church in [[Kazimierz]] by Kraków.

==Legacy==

The most important work of Berrecci is the chapel of the last [[Jagiellonians]], the [[Sigismund Chapel]] for King [[Sigismund I the Old]] at the [[Wawel]] (1517–1533) in Kraków; It is considered to be the most beautiful piece of Italian Renaissance architecture outside of Italy. Some years later [[Santi Gucci]] built the tombs of King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] and Queen [[Anna Jagiellon]] (the son and daughter of Sigismund I) inside the chapel. His death in 1537 was the result of an infection caused by a worksite accident during work on the tomb of Piotr Tomicki.&lt;ref&gt;http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/bartolomeo-berecci&lt;/ref&gt;

Berrecci's other works include:
* rebuilding the [[Wawel]] royal castle
* extension of the [[Niepołomice Castle]]
* baldachin for the tomb of [[Władysław II Jagiełło]]
* tomb for the bishops Jan Konarski (died 1525) and Piotr Tomicki (died 1535) in the [[Wawel Cathedral]]
* tomb of Barbara Tarnowska and the tombs of the three Jans in the Cathedral in [[Tarnów]].

He is one of the characters on the famous painting by [[Jan Matejko]], ''[[Prussian Homage (painting)|Prussian Homage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/bartolomeo-berecci&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Krakow-Wawel-Courtyard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eberhard Rosemberger]] and Francesco Florentino - [[Wawel]], [[Kraków]]]]

'''Francesco the &quot;Fiorentine&quot;''' was an Italian renaissance architect and sculptor from [[Florence]], Italy. His date of birth is unknown. He died 16 October 1516 in Kraków.

==Life==
This Italian architect was the earliest representative of renaissance in Poland. There is no information about his life or his work before he came to Poland. Probably he appeared for the first time in Poland, Kraków in February 1502 for Prince Zygmunt’s request. [[Zygmunt I Stary]] (1 January 1467 – 1 April 1548) was the King of Poland (24 January 1507 – 1 April 1548) and Grand Duke of Lithuania (20 October 1506 – 1 April 1548) and was and the main promoter of renaissance style in Poland. Prince Zygmunt offered him one-year service with 100 florins (gold coins from Florence) salary. Probably, Fiorentine arrived with prince Zygmunt from Hungary. From February, 1502 Francesco lived and worked in [[Kraków]], Poland with exceptions for journeys to Buda ([[Budapest]]), Hungary in 1507 and 1510. 
Prince Zygmunt arrived from Hungary not only with Franscesco Fiorentine, but with whole architectural-sculptural team mainly composed from Florentines people. Prince set up a studio near to his residence, which was led by Fiorentine.

==Works==
The first work he undertook was rebuilding two wings of [[Wawel Castle]] ([[Royal Castle on Wawel]]), which was burned in 1500. At first he worked on the Western wing called ‘Queen’s House’ (1502-1507), which was intended for Elżbieta’s home – prince Zygmunt’s mother. It was the first stage of rebuilding in renaissance style of this residence. Remainder of this rebuilding are reliefly frames of windows on the second level from courtyard side. One of this reliefly frames is the setting of the bay window. 
Then he worked on the northern wing (1507–16). It is hard to describe scope of his works, but supposedly he is, among the other things, the author of decoration rocks – the frame of windows and bay window on the second floor of elevation from the courtyard in Western wing.

Fiorentine was the author of galleries enclosing large castle courtyard. It was the most important part (in artistic way) of rebuilding by this Italian man. Building started in 1507 and was continuing by [[Bartolomeo Berrecci]] (1480-1537) (Italian architect and sculptor from renaissance, who also worked for Zygmunt I Stary in Kraków) and after his death by his collaborators. This courtyard is considered as the most beautiful renaissance courtyard in the Middle Europe. The galleries, which made the main communication area of the building were used to representative and sociable goals. It also enabled royal people assisting in ceremonies and tournaments. The galleries were built on three levels and spread on wing walls of the castle. It has arcades on a first and second levels. It makes impression that it tidy up the courtyard in a spatial way and decorate it.  Fiorentine, as a renaissance architect was deriving from Antic art, but in a freely way, so that architectural order is not in accordance with classical rules. In the highest level, each of the galleries is folding from two stems, which are put up one on the other and connected by knots, which never meet. It has triple function: connecting, crowning and bearing. Worth of comment are also jugs placed on a capitals. This rebuilding changed gothic castle into renaissance residence.

His great masterpiece is also [[Jan Olbracht]]’s (27 December 1459 – 17 June 1501, King of Poland 1492-1501) niche of tomb, which was founded by [[Elizabeth of Austria (1436–1505)|Elisabeth of Austria]], who was polish Queen [[Elżbieta Rakuszanka]] (Habsburżanka) (1436-30 August 1505) – Queen of Poland (10 February 1454 - 7 June 1492) and Grand Duchess of Lithuania. She was daughter of [[Albrecht II Habsburg]] – King of Germany and Hungary and his wife [[Elizabeth of Luxembourg]]. She was married to [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellończyk]] (30 November 1427 – 7 June 1492) – Grand Duke of Lithuania (29 June 1440 – 7 June 1492) and King of Poland (25 June 1447 – 7 June 1492). Queen founded tomb after the death of her beloved son (1501). The co-founder was prince Zygmunt. Their contribution mark out border of style ages, which was important not only for [[Wawel]], but for whole [[Kraków]]. Probably, after prince Zygmunt and Fiorentine arrived from Hungary, the tomb, with shape of [[Jan Olbracht]]’s was already done in gothic style by [[Stanislaw Stwosz]] (1478-1528) – sculptor and son of [[Wit Stwosz]]’s (1448-1533) also sculptor and painter. Later, this tomb was placed into the niche made by Fiorentine. Because of the wide of the tomb, the niche had to be made not so small. It had to be very deep, but also not so high. Eventually the niche was really wide, deep and heavy, so it needed even pilasters on the sides of heavily closure. Ornamentation of Jan Olbracht’s monument niche is richly decorated. 
Therefore, Fiorentine made architectural and sculptural frame for [[Jan Olbracht]]’s tomb in  [[Wawel Cathedral]] (1501-05).

Francesco Fiorentino also made entrance portal to Bishop E. Ciolek’s palace on Kanoniczna 17 street in Krakow.

==Style==
Francesco was main designer and partly contractor of his masterpieces. His works are describing as ‘pure’ toscan renaissance. His realizations are also very precisie. It seems, some of his works are inspiration of foreign works. For example, the form of [[Jan Olbracht]]’s tomb is reminiscent of works by [[Bernardo Rosselino]] in the 15th century. The ornamental form is similar to the decoration of [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino|Palazzo Ducale]] in Urbino and the other connections in stone works from Hungary.

By composition and ornament details his works are obviously connected with the arts of Florence. His style and origin justified his nickname – Fiorentine.

After his death in 1516, works took over his successor – [[Bartolomeo Berrecci]] from [[Pontassieve]], Italy, who was managing works until 1537, when he died. Francesco Fiorentine was (as well as Berrecci and many other artists from their country) outstanding creator and gathered around himself highly qualified workers. He was authority for many, because of his high court function and his masterpieces. He was representative of uniformly toscan renaissance style. Artistic works, which began after his death created Italian way of renaissance art in Poland.

His architectural and sculptural activity began development of renaissance art in Poland. His unfinished works were continued by the other Florentines, mainly by [[Bartolomeo Berrecci]].

Probably he had a wife – Helena from Italy and son – sculptor [[Jan Fiorentine]], who worked in his father’s team.

'''Francisco de Mora''' (c.1553&amp;ndash;1610) was a Spanish Renaissance architect.

Mora was born in [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], and was an uncle of both the architect [[Juan Gómez de Mora]] and the humanist [[Baltasar Porreño]]. He is considered one of the best representatives of [[Herrerian]] architecture, a style that developed in the last third of the 16th century, although his best work also anticipates the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] currents that would dominate 17th-century architecture. He was the designer of the [[Convento de San José (Ávila)|Convento de San José]] ([[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]]) and of the [[Palacio ducal de Lerma]] ([[Lerma, Burgos|Lerma]], [[province of Burgos|Burgos]]), which had a major influence on later religious and secular architecture.  He died in [[Madrid]].

'''Juan de Herrera''' (1530 – 15 January 1597) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[architect]], [[mathematician]] and [[geometrician]].

One of the most outstanding Spanish architects in the 16th century, Herrera represents the peak of the [[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance in Spain]]. His sober style was fully developed in buildings like the Monastery of [[San Lorenzo de El Escorial]].  The ''[[Herrerian]]'' style was named after him, and was representative of the architecture of the Spanish Empire of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his Austrian successors.

As a Renaissance man, Herrera was interested in all the branches of knowledge of his times. His ''Discurso sobre la figura cúbica'' (Discussion of the Cubic form) tells us about his notable knowledge about geometry and mathematics. He also participated in the military campaigns of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in Germany, Flanders and Italy.

==Biography==
Juan de Herrera completed his studies at the [[University of Valladolid]] in the spring of 1548. He started his architectural career in 1561 with the works in the [[Palacio Real de Aranjuez|Royal Palace of Aranjuez]], following it in 1562 with ''Libro del saber de astronomía'' (''The Book of Astronomical Knowledge''). 

In 1563 he started to work under [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] in the construction of [[El Escorial]]. After the death of de Toledo in 1567, Herrera became the director architect of the works, enlarging the plan, building the monumental western façade, the central Basilica and the pavilion of the ''Patio de los Evangelistas'' (Court of the Evangelists), and modifying the construction techniques and roofing. Stylistically, he changed the image of the façades and introducing his personal sober style. The main keys of his design are the impressive horizontal unified composition and the use of bare granite, omitting the classical orders for large surface. This style introduced in the monastery influenced [[Spanish architecture]] for over a century with the name of [[Herrerian]] style.

The plans of the [[Cathedral of Valladolid]] and the [[Archivo General de Indias]] were also designed by him. He was the original designer for the [[Plaza Mayor of Madrid|Plaza Mayor in Madrid]].

As instructed in his 1584 will, his sepulchre is located in the Church of San Juan Bautista, in [[Maliaño]], [[Cantabria]].

'''Leon Battista Alberti''' ({{IPA-it|leˈom batˈtista alˈbɛrti}}; February 14, 1404 – April 25, 1472) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] author, artist, [[architect]], [[poet]], [[Catholic priest|priest]], [[linguistics|linguist]], [[philosopher]] and [[cryptography|cryptographer]]; he epitomised the [[Polymath|Renaissance Man]]. Although he is often characterized as an &quot;architect&quot; exclusively, as James Beck has observed,&lt;ref&gt;James Beck, &quot;Leon Battista Alberti and the 'Night Sky' at San Lorenzo&quot;, ''Artibus et Historiae'' '''10''', No. 19 (1989:9–35), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts.&quot;  Alberti's life was described in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]].

==Life==
Leon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in [[Genoa]] to a wealthy Florentine father who had been exiled from his own city, but who was allowed to return in 1428.  Alberti, whose mother is unknown, and who was probably illegitimate, was sent to boarding school in Padua, then studied Law at [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name=MS&gt;Melissa Snell, ''[http://historymedren.about.com/od/awho/a/bio_alberti.htm Leon Battsta Alberti]'', About.com: Medieval History.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived for a time in [[Florence]], then travelled to Rome in 1431, where he took [[holy orders]] and entered the service of the papal court.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt;  At this time he studied the [[Ancient Roman architecture|ancient ruins]], which excited his interest in architecture and strongly influenced the form of the buildings that he designed.&lt;ref name=IL&gt;''The Renaissance:a Illustrated Encyclopedia'', Octopus (1979) ISBN 0706408578&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti was gifted in many directions.  He was tall, strong and a fine athlete, who could ride the wildest horse and jump over a man's head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renaissance Italy 1860&quot;/&gt;  He distinguished himself as a writer while he was still a child at school, and by the age of twenty had written a play which was successfully passed off as a genuine piece of Classical literature.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;   In 1435, he began his first major written work, ''[[De Pictura|Della pittura]]'', in which, inspired by the burgeoning of pictorial art in Florence in the early 15th century, he analyses the nature of painting and explores the elements of perspective, composition and colour.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt;

In 1438 he began to take a serious interest in architecture, encouraged by the Marchese [[Leonello d'Este]] of Ferrara, for whom he built a small [[triumphal arch]] to support an equestrian statue of Leonello's father.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt; In 1447 he became the architectural advisor to [[Pope Nicholas V]] and was involved with a number of projects at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;

His first major architectural commission was in 1446 at 4pm UTC for the facade of the [[Rucellai Palace]] in Florence. This was followed in 1450 by a commission from [[Sigismondo Malatesta]] to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in [[Rimini]] into a memorial chapel, the [[Tempio Malatestiano]].&lt;ref name=IL/&gt; In Florence, he designed the upper parts of the facade for the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], famously bridging the nave and lower aisles with two ornately inlaid scrolls, solving a visual problem and setting a precedent to be followed by architects of churches for four hundred years.&lt;ref name=AD49&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ed., ''Leon Baptiste Alberti'', Architectul Design, Vol 49 No 5-6, London&lt;/ref&gt; In 1452, he completed  ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'', a treatise on architecture, using as its basis the work of [[Vitruvius]] and influenced by the archaeological remains of Rome. The work was not published until 1485.  It was followed in 1464 by his less influential work, ''De statua'', in which he examines sculpture.&lt;ref name=IL/&gt; Alberti's only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion, sometimes attributed to [[Pisanello]].
[[File:Palácio Rucellai.jpg|thumb|right|Palazzo Rucellai]]
Alberti was employed to design two churches in [[Mantua]], [[San Sebastiano (Mantua)|San Sebastiano]], which was never completed, and for which Alberti's intention can only be speculated, and the [[Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]]. The design for the latter church was completed in 1471, a year before Alberti's death, but was brought to completion and is his most significant work.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

As an artist, Alberti distinguished himself from the ordinary craftsman, educated in workshops. He was a [[humanism|humanist]], and part of the rapidly expanding entourage of intellectuals and artisans supported by the courts of the princes and lords of the time. Alberti, as a member of noble family and as part of the Roman [[curia]], had special status. He was a welcomed guest at the [[House of Este|Este]] court in [[Ferrara]], and in [[Urbino]] he spent part of the hot-weather season with the [[condottieri|soldier-prince]] [[Federico III da Montefeltro]]. The [[Duke of Urbino]] was a shrewd military commander, who generously spent money on the [[patronage]] of art. Alberti planned to dedicate his [[treatise]] on architecture to his friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renaissance Italy 1860&quot;/&gt;

Among Alberti's smaller studies, pioneering in their field, were a treatise in [[cryptography]], ''[[Alberti cipher|De componendis cifris]]'', and the first Italian [[grammar]]. With the Florentine cosmographer [[Paolo Toscanelli]] he collaborated in astronomy, a close science to geography at that time, and produced a small Latin work on geography, ''Descriptio urbis Romae'' (''The Panorama of the City of Rome''). Just a few years before his death, Alberti completed ''De iciarchia'' (''On Ruling the Household''), a dialogue about Florence during the [[Medici]] rule.

Alberti, having taken holy orders, remained unmarried all his life. He loved animals and had a pet dog, a mongrel, for whom he wrote a [[panegyric]], ''Canis'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Renaissance Italy 1860&quot;/&gt; Vasari describes him as &quot;an admirable citizen, a man of culture.... a friend of talented men, open and courteous with everyone. He always lived honourably and like the gentleman he was.&quot;&lt;ref name=Vasari&gt;Vasari, ''The Lives of the Artists''&lt;/ref&gt;  Alberti died in Rome on April 25, 1472 at the age of 68.

{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}

Alberti regarded mathematics as the common ground of art and the sciences. &quot;To make clear my exposition in writing this brief commentary on [[painting]],&quot; Alberti began his treatise, ''Della Pittura'' (On Painting), &quot;I will take first from the mathematicians those things with which my subject is concerned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Leone Battista Alberti, On Painting, editor John Richard Spencer, 1956, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Della pittura'' (also known in Latin as ''[[De Pictura]]'') relied in its scientific content on classical [[optics]] in determining [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] as a geometric instrument of artistic and architectural representation.  Alberti was well-versed in the sciences of his age. His knowledge of [[optics]] was connected to the handed-down long-standing tradition of the ''Kitab al-manazir'' (''The Optics''; ''De aspectibus'') of the Arab polymath [[Alhazen]] ([[Ibn al-Haytham]], d. c. 1041), which was mediated by Franciscan optical workshops of the 13th-century ''Perspectivae'' traditions of scholars such as [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Peckham]] and [[Witelo]] (similar influences are also traceable in the third commentary of [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], ''Commentario terzo'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], &quot;A Philosophical Perspective on [[Alhazen]]’s [[Optics]],&quot; ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', vol. 15, issue 2 (2005), pp. 189–218 ([[Cambridge University Press]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Archtitecture of Leon Battista Alberti title page.jpg|thumb|English title page of the first edition of Giacomo Leoni’s translation of Alberti’s ''De Re Aedificatoria'' (1452). The book is bilingual, with the Italian version being printed on the left and the English version printed on the right.]]
In both ''Della pittura'' and ''De statua'', Alberti stressed that &quot;all steps of learning should be sought from nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=kirjasto&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/alberti.htm |title=Leon Battista Alberti |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://greencardamom.github.io/BooksAndWriters/alberti.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate aim of an artist is to imitate nature. Painters and sculptors strive &quot;through by different skills, at the same goal, namely that as nearly as possible the work they have undertaken shall appear to the observer to be similar to the real objects of nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; However, Alberti did not mean that artists should imitate nature objectively, as it is, but the artist should be especially attentive to beauty, &quot;for in painting beauty is as pleasing as it is necessary.&quot;&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; The work of art is, according to Alberti, so constructed that it is impossible to take anything away from it or add anything to it, without impairing the beauty of the whole. Beauty was for Alberti &quot;the harmony of all parts in relation to one another,&quot; and subsequently &quot;this concord is realized in a particular number, proportion, and arrangement demanded by harmony.&quot; Alberti's thoughts on harmony were not new—they could be traced back to Pythagoras—but he set them in a fresh context, which fit in well with the contemporary aesthetic discourse.

In Rome, Alberti had plenty of time to study its ancient sites, ruins, and objects. His detailed observations, included in his ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'' (1452, ''On the Art of Building''),&lt;ref name=DeRe&gt;Alberti,Leon Battista. On ''the Art of Building in Ten Books''. Trans. Leach, N., Rykwert, J., &amp; Tavenor, R. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; were patterned after the ''De architectura'' by the Roman architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 46–30 BC). The work was the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance. It covered a wide range of subjects, from history to town planning, and engineering to the philosophy of beauty. ''De re aedificatoria,'' a large and expensive book, was not fully published until 1485, after which it became a major reference for architects.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., [http://www.palladiancenter.org/predecessors.html Palladio's Literary Predecessors]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book was written &quot;not only for craftsmen but also for anyone interested in the noble arts,&quot; as Alberti put it.&lt;ref name=DeRe/&gt; Originally published in Latin, the first Italian edition came out in 1546. and the standard Italian edition by [[Cosimo Bartoli]] was published in 1550. Pope [[Nicholas V]], to whom Alberti dedicated the whole work, dreamed of rebuilding the city of Rome, but he managed to realize only a fragment of his visionary plans. Through his book, Alberti opened up his theories and ideals of the Florentine Renaissance to architects, scholars and others.

Alberti wrote ''I Libri della famiglia''—which discussed education, marriage, household management, and money—in the Tuscan dialect. The work was not printed until 1843. Like [[Erasmus]] decades later, Alberti stressed the need for a reform in education. He noted that &quot;the care of very young children is women's work, for nurses or the mother,&quot; and that at the earliest possible age children should be taught the alphabet.&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; With great hopes, he gave the work to his family to read, but in his autobiography Alberti confesses that &quot;he could hardly avoid feeling rage, moreover, when he saw some of his relatives openly ridiculing both the whole work and the author's futile enterprise along it.&quot;&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; ''Momus'', written between 1443 and 1450, was a misogynist comedy about the Olympian gods. It has been considered as a [[roman à clef]]—[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] has been identified in some sources as Pope Eugenius IV and Pope Nicholas V. Alberti borrowed many of its characters from [[Lucian]], one of his favorite Greek writers. The name of its hero, Momus, refers to the Greek word for blame or criticism. After being expelled from heaven, [[Momus]], the god of mockery, is eventually castrated. Jupiter and the other gods come down to earth also, but they return to heaven after Jupiter breaks his nose in a great storm.

Alberti did not concern himself with the practicalities of building, and very few of his major works were brought to completion.  As a designer and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman remains, he grasped the nature of column and lintel architecture, from the visual rather than structural viewpoint, and correctly employed the [[Classical orders]], unlike his contemporary, [[Brunelleschi]], who utilised the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Among Alberti's concerns was the social effect of architecture, and to this end he was very well aware of the cityscape.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt; This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a continuous bench for seating at the level of the basement.

In [[Rome]] he was employed by [[Pope Nicholas V]] for the restoration of the [[Roman aqueduct]] of [[Acqua Vergine]], which [[debouches|debouched]] into a simple basin designed by Alberti, which was swept away later by the Baroque [[Trevi Fountain]].

Some studies&lt;ref&gt;D. Mazzini, S. Simone, ''Villa Medici a Fiesole. Leon Battista Alberti e il prototipo di villa rinascimentale'', Centro Di, Firenze 2004&lt;/ref&gt; propose that the [[Villa Medici in Fiesole]] might owe its design to Alberti, not to Michelozzo, and that it then became the prototype of the [[Renaissance]] [[villa]]. This hilltop dwelling, commissioned by [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], [[Cosimo il Vecchio]]'s second son, with its view over the city, may be the very first example of a Renaissance villa: that is to say it follows the Albertian criteria for rendering a country dwelling a &quot;villa suburbana&quot;. Under this perspective the Villa Medici in Fiesole could therefore be considered the &quot;muse&quot; for numerous other buildings, not only in the Florence area, which from the end of the 15th century onwards find inspiration and creative innovation here.

===Tempio Malatestiano, Rimini===
The [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in [[Rimini]] (1447, 1453–60)&lt;ref name=Borsi&gt;Franco Borsi. ''Leon Battista Alberti''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; is the rebuilding of a Gothic church.  The facade, with its dynamic play of forms, was left incomplete.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Façade of Palazzo Rucellai===
The design of the façade of the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] (1446–51) was one of several commissions for the Rucellai family.&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; The design overlays a grid of shallow pilasters and cornices in the Classical manner onto rusticated masonry, and is surmounted by a heavy cornice. The inner courtyard has [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns.  The palace set a standard in the use of Classical elements that is original in civic buildings in Florence, and greatly influenced later palazzi. The work was executed by [[Bernardo Rosselino]].&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Santa Maria Novella===
At [[Santa Maria Novella]], Florence, between (1448–70)&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; the upper facade was constructed to the design of Alberti. It was a challenging task, as the lower level already had three doorways and six [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] niches containing tombs and employing the polychrome marble typical of Florentine churches such as [[San Miniato al Monte]] and the [[Baptistery of Florence]]. The design also incorporates an [[rose window|ocular window]] which was already in place. Alberti introduced Classical features around the portico and spread the polychromy over the entire facade in a manner which includes Classical proportions and elements such as pilasters, cornices and a pediment in the Classical style, ornamented with a sunburst in tesserae, rather than sculpture. The best known feature of this typically aisled church is the manner in which Alberti has solved the problem of visually bridging the different levels of the central nave and much lower side aisles. He employed two large scrolls, which were to become a standard feature of Church facades in the later Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Revival buildings.&lt;ref name=AD49/&gt;

===Pienza===
[[File:Pienza Piazza Pio II.JPG|thumb|upright= 1.5|Piazza Pio II in Pienza, looking towards the Palazzo Piccolomini]]
Alberti is considered to have been the consultant for the design of the Piazza Pio II, [[Pienza]]. The village, previously called Corsignano, was redesigned beginning around 1459.&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; It was the birthplace of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, [[Pope Pius II]], in whose employ Alberti served.  Pius II wanted to use the village as a retreat but needed for it to reflect the dignity of his position.

The  piazza is a [[trapezoid]] shape defined by four buildings, with a focus on Pienza Cathedral and passages on either side opening onto a landscape view. The principal residence, ''Palazzo Piccolomini'', is on the west side. It has three stories, articulated by pilasters and entablature courses, with a twin-lighted cross window set within each bay. This structure is similar to Alberti's [[Palazzo Rucellai]] in Florence and other later palaces. Noteworthy is the internal court of the palazzo. The back of the palace, to the south, is defined by [[loggia]] on all three floors that overlook an enclosed [[Italian Renaissance garden]] with ''[[Giardino all'italiana]]'' era modifications, and spectacular views into the distant landscape of the [[Val d'Orcia]] and Pope Pius's beloved Mount Amiata beyond.  Below this garden is a vaulted stable that had stalls for 100 horses. The design, which radically transformed the center of the town, included a palace for the pope, a church, a town hall and a building for the bishops who would accompany the Pope on his trips. Pienza is considered an early example of Renaissance urban planning.

===Sant' Andrea, Mantua===
The [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]], [[Mantua]] was begun in 1471,&lt;ref name=Borsi/&gt; the year before Alberti's death. It was brought to completion and is his most significant work employing the [[triumphal arch]] motif, both for its facade and interior, and influencing many works that were to follow.&lt;ref name= AD49/&gt;  Alberti perceived the role of architect as designer. Unlike [[Brunelleschi]], he had no interest in the construction, leaving the practicalities to builders and the oversight to others.&lt;ref name= AD49/&gt;

===Other buildings===

==Painting==
[[Giorgio Vasari]], who argued that historical progress in art reached its peak in [[Michelangelo]], emphasized Alberti's scholarly achievements, not his artistic talents: &quot;He spent his time finding out about the world and studying the proportions of antiquities; but above all, following his natural genius, he concentrated on writing rather than on applied work.&quot; &lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt; [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], who ironically called himself &quot;an uneducated person&quot; (''omo senza lettere''), followed Alberti in the view that painting is science. However, as a scientist Leonardo was more empirical than Alberti, who was a theorist and did not have similar interest in practice. Alberti believed in ideal beauty, but Leonardo filled his notebooks with observations on human proportions, page after page, ending with his famous drawing of the [[Vitruvian man]], a human figure related to a square and a circle.

In ''On Painting'', Alberti uses the expression &quot;We Painters&quot;, but as a painter, or sculptor, he was a dilettante. &quot;In painting Alberti achieved nothing of any great importance or beauty,&quot; wrote Vasari.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt; &quot;The very few paintings of his that are extant are far from perfect, but this is not surprising since he devoted himself more to his studies than to draughtsmanship.&quot; [[Jacob Burckhardt]] portrayed Alberti in ''The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy'' as a truly universal genius. &quot;And Leonardo Da Vinci was to Alberti as the finisher to the beginner, as the master to the dilettante. Would only that Vasari's work were here supplemented by a description like that of Alberti! The colossal outlines of Leonardo's nature can never be more than dimly and distantly conceived.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Renaissance Italy 1860&quot;&gt;Jacob Burckhardt in [[s:The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy#Personality|''The Civilization of the Renaissance Italy'', 2.1]], 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti is said to be in Mantegna's great frescoes in the [[Camera degli Sposi]], the older man dressed in dark red clothes, who whispers in the ear of [[Ludovico III Gonzaga|Ludovico Gonzaga]], the ruler of Mantua.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} In Alberti's self-portrait, a large [[plaquette]], he is clothed as a Roman. To the left of his profile is a winged eye. On the reverse side is the question, ''Quid tum?'' (what then), taken from [[Virgil]]'s ''Eclogues'': &quot;So what, if Amyntas is dark? (''quid tum si fuscus Amyntas?'') Violets are black, and hyacinths are black.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Contributions==
[[File:Tempio malatestiano, ri, facciata, capitello.JPG|thumb|Detail of the facade of [[Tempio Malatestiano]]]]
Alberti made a variety of contributions to several fields:
* Alberti was the creator of a theory called &quot;historia&quot;. In his treatise ''[[De pictura]]'' (1435) he explains the theory of the accumulation of people, animals, and buildings, which create harmony amongst each other, and &quot;hold the eye of the learned and unlearned spectator for a long while with a certain sense of pleasure and emotion&quot;.  ''[[De pictura]]'' (&quot;On Painting&quot;) contained the first scientific study of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. An [[Italian language|Italian]] translation of ''De pictura'' (''Della pittura'') was published in 1436, one year after the original Latin version and addressed [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] in the preface. The Latin version had been dedicated to Alberti's humanist patron,  Gianfrancesco Gonzaga of Mantua. He also wrote works on [sculpture], ''[[:it:De statua|De Statua]]''.
* Alberti used his artistic treatises to propound a new humanistic theory of art. He drew on his contacts with early Quattrocento artists such as Brunelleschi, Donatello and Ghiberti to provide a practical handbook for the renaissance artist.
* Alberti wrote an influential work on architecture, ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', which by the 16th century had been translated into Italian (by Cosimo Bartoli), [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]]. An English translation was by [[Giacomo Leoni]] in the early 18th century. Newer translations are now available.
* Whilst Alberti's treatises on painting and architecture have been hailed as the founding texts of a new form of art, breaking from the Gothic past, it is impossible to know the extent of their practical impact within his lifetime. His praise of the ''Calumny of Apelles'' led to several attempts to emulate it, including paintings by Botticelli and Signorelli. His stylistic ideals have been put into practice in the works of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Fra Angelico]]. But how far Alberti was responsible for these innovations and how far he was simply articulating the trends of the artistic movement, with which his practical experience had made him familiar, is impossible to ascertain.
* He was so skilled in [[Latin]] verse that a [[comedy]] he wrote in his twentieth year, entitled ''Philodoxius'', would later deceive the younger [[Aldus Manutius]], who edited and published it as the genuine work of 'Lepidus Comicus'.

[[File:Toscana24te.jpg|thumb|The upper storey of [[Santa Maria Novella]]]]
[[File:Santa Maria Novella (Florence) - 0851.jpg|thumb|One of the giant scrolls at Santa Maria Novella]]
* He has been credited with being the author, or alternatively the designer of the [[woodcut]] illustrations, of the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', a strange [[fantasy]] novel.&lt;ref&gt;Liane Lefaivre, ''Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili'', Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apart from his treatises on the arts, Alberti also wrote: ''Philodoxus'' (&quot;Lover of Glory&quot;, 1424), ''De commodis litterarum atque incommodis'' (&quot;On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Literary Studies&quot;, 1429), ''Intercoenales'' (&quot;Table Talk&quot;, c. 1429), ''Della famiglia'' (&quot;On the Family&quot;, begun 1432) ''Vita S. Potiti'' (&quot;Life of St. Potitus&quot;, 1433), ''De iure'' (On Law, 1437), ''Theogenius'' (&quot;The Origin of the Gods&quot;, c. 1440), ''Profugorium ab aerumna'' (&quot;Refuge from Mental Anguish&quot;,), ''Momus'' (1450) and ''De Iciarchia'' (&quot;On the Prince&quot;, 1468). These and other works were translated and printed in Venice by the humanist [[Cosimo Bartoli]] in 1586.
* Alberti was an accomplished [[cryptography|cryptographer]] by the standard of his day, and invented the first [[polyalphabetic cipher]], which is now known as the [[Alberti cipher]], and machine-assisted encryption using his [[Alberti Cipher Disk|Cipher Disk]]. The polyalphabetic cipher was, at least in principle, for it was not properly used for several hundred years, the most significant advance in cryptography since before Julius Caesar's time. Cryptography historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] titles him the &quot;Father of Western Cryptography&quot;, pointing to three significant advances in the field which can be attributed to Alberti: &quot;the earliest Western exposition of cryptanalysis, the invention of polyalphabetic substitution, and the invention of enciphered code.&quot;{{cite book |author=David Kahn |title=The codebreakers: the story of secret writing |publisher=MacMillan |location=New York |year=1967}}
* According to Alberti himself, in a short autobiography written c. 1438 in Latin and in the third person, (many but not all scholars consider this work to be an autobiography) he was capable of &quot;standing with his feet together, and springing over a man's head.&quot; The autobiography survives thanks to an 18th-century transcription by [[Antonio Muratori]]. Alberti also claimed that he &quot;excelled in all bodily exercises; could, with feet tied, leap over a standing man; could in the great cathedral, throw a coin far up to ring against the vault; amused himself by taming wild horses and climbing mountains.&quot; Needless to say, many in the Renaissance promoted themselves in various ways and Alberti's eagerness to promote his skills should be understood, to some extent, within that framework. (This advice should be followed in reading the above information, some of which originates in this so-called autobiography.)
* Alberti claimed in his &quot;autobiography&quot; to be an accomplished musician and organist, but there is no hard evidence to support this claim. In fact, musical posers were not uncommon in his day (see the lyrics to the song ''Musica Son'', by Francesco Landini, for complaints to this effect.) He held the appointment of canon in the metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Church|church]] of [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], and thus – perhaps – had the leisure to devote himself to this art, but this is only speculation. Vasari also agreed with this.&lt;ref name=Vasari/&gt;
* He was also interested in the drawing of [[map]]s and worked with the [[astronomer]], astrologer, and [[cartographer]] [[Paolo Toscanelli]].
* In terms of Aesthetics Alberti is one of the first defining the work of art as imitation of nature, exactly as a selection of its most beautiful parts: &quot;So let's take from nature what we are going to paint, and from nature we choose the most beautiful and worthy things&quot;&lt;ref&gt;De Pictura, book III: Ergo semper quae picturi sumus, ea a natura sumamus, semperque ex his quaeque pulcherrima et dignissima deligamus.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giovanni Battista di Quadro''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''Jan Baptysta Quadro'', [[Latin]] ''Joannes Baptista Quadro'') (died between 10 April 1590 and 16 January 1591) was a Swiss-Italian renaissance architect, one of the most famous architects in Central Europe in his epoque.

==Biography==
He was born [[Ponte Tresa]] or [[Cadro]], near [[Lugano]] (today [[Switzerland]]).

Until 1550 he probably worked in [[Saxony]] and [[Silesia]], but on 13 March 1550 he signed a contract with the city council of [[Poznań]] for rebuilding the [[town hall]]. In 1551 with the agreement of the council he went to [[Płock]] as a consultant on the renovation of the cathedral. In the same year his name was mentioned in the court books of Poznań because of links between him and the [[bishops of Poznań|Bishop of Poznań]] [[Benedykt Izdebski]] relating to building the bishop's palace in [[Krobia]]. From 1552 to 1562 di Quadro was the City Architect of Poznań, but the City Council paid him also in 1563, 1566, 1567 and 1570 for minor works. During these years, he worked for the citizens of Poznań and the clergy and nobles of [[Greater Poland]].

From 1568 to 1572 he worked in [[Warsaw]] rebuilding today's [[Royal Castle in Warsaw|Royal Castle]].

His many well paid jobs made him wealthy. However, after he retired in 1573, he died as an indebted person in Poznań.

In years 1550-1552 in Poznań worked also his brothers Antoni, Gabriel and Kilian di Quadro.

'''Aloisio the New''', known in [[Russian language|Russian]] as ''Aleviz Novyi'' or ''Aleviz Fryazin'', was an [[Italian Renaissance]] architect invited by [[Ivan III]] to work in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolodziejczyk&quot;&gt;Dariusz Kolodziejczyk, ''The Crimean Khanate and Poland-Lithuania: International Diplomacy on the European Periphery'', (Brill, 2011), xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Italian scholars have attempted to identify him with the Venetian sculptor '''Alevisio Lamberti da Montagnano''', but the point is still widely disputed.

On his way to Russia, Aloisio was apprehended by [[Meñli I Giray]], the [[Khan (title)|khan]] of [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolodziejczyk&quot; /&gt; At his court, Aloisio built some sections of the famous palace in [[Bakhchisaray]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolodziejczyk&quot; /&gt; The Italianate carved portal of the palace is particularly noteworthy.

In 1504 he finally arrived to [[Moscow]], with a letter of recommendation from the khan.
He became known to Russians as Aleviz the New, to distinguish him from [[Aloisio da Milano|his namesake]], who had been working at the Kremlin since 1494. Aloisio's first and principal work in Moscow was the [[Archangel Cathedral]], the burial place of Muscovite monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;William Craft Brumfield, ''Landmarks of Russian Architect'', (Routledge, 2013), 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral's elaborate Renaissance ornamentation was extensively copied throughout 16th-century Russia.

Aloisio the New was last mentioned in 1514, when he was entrusted by [[Vasily III]] to build 11 churches in [[Moscow]]. Although only parts of these structures have been preserved, there is enough evidence to assume that they were built in strikingly differing styles. The best preserved of these churches is the cathedral of the [[Vysokopetrovsky Monastery]] in [[Moscow]] (1514–17), admittedly the earliest [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] in Russia.

'''Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger''' (24 June 1587 &amp;ndash; 6 August 1639) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]]-[[Denmark|Danish]] [[Architecture|architect]] who specialised in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], typical of prestigious Danish buildings from the first half of the 17th century. Along with his brother [[Lorenz van Steenwinckel]] he was responsible for most of King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s many ambitious building projects.

He was the son of [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Elder]] and the father of [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Youngest]] and probably also the building master and engineer [[Oluf van Steenwinckel]].

==Career==
Hans and Lorenz van Steenwinckel  were sons of the prime contractor and stonecutter [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Elder]] who was originally from [[Antwerp]] but had come to Denmark in 1576 to work on [[Kronborg Castle]] and subsequently became the preferred architect of [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]]. It was natural that he followed in his father's footsteps and together with his brother Lorenz he went to the [[Netherlands]] to study architecture and stone carving.

Back in Denmark, Hans and Lorenz van Steenwinckel would become involved in most of Christian IV's numerous huge building projects in the first decades of the 17th century, though it is often not clear exactly what their share was. Often many people have participated in the design of a building, both because of the extensive construction times from initial plans to completed building which was common at that time. In the same time large prestige buildings were far from static entities, rather it was normal for them to see numerous extensions and reconstructions, developing gradually over the years. The enthusiastic king Christian IV himself is also known to have taken active part in the design of his many large buildings. To make matters even unclearer, it was a strategy of Christian IV, and possibly his advisors, to keep the authorship of a building hidden to suggest that king himself was the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.dk/books?id=XeDxJ0g5AokC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=Hans+van+Steenwinckel+the+Elder+Slangerup&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TNpQ2jh0Cv&amp;sig=AColKiHMeWldMI3lEzw8h1FjGDg&amp;hl=da&amp;ei=eE4uS7bIJ5TH-Qbd8PiPBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hans%20van%20Steenwinckel%20the%20Elder%20Slangerup&amp;f=false|title=The North Sea and culture (1550-1800|publisher=Hilversum : Verloren,|accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of his career, Hans van Steenwinckel worked mainly as a sculptor, executing works both for [[Kronborg Castle]] and [[Frederiksborg Palace]]. He is credited for the octagonal tower at [[Rosenborg Castle]].

After Lorenz' death in 1619, Hans was appointed new Royal Master Builder, and took over ongoing projects, such as Christian IV's Chapel at [[Roskilde Cathedral]],under development since 1613, and the newly commenced [[Børsen|Stock Exchange]] in Copenhagen.

With the Trinitatis Complex, which includes the [[Rundetårn|Round Tower]] and [[Trinitatis Church]], he turned to the new [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque style]], abandoning the Dutch Renaissance style which had until then been synonymous with his name.It was not completed until after his death.

* [[Rosenborg Castle]] - the octagonal tower (1616)

'''Gilles Le Breton''' (died 1553) was a French [[architect]] and master-mason during the [[Renaissance]]. He is best known as the mastermind of much of the present-day [[Château de Fontainebleau]].

In 1526, Le Breton was working at the [[Château de Chambord]] under Pierre Nepveu. In 1527, he was appointed “maître général des oeuvres de Maçonnerie du roi,” or master-mason.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Architects of the Renaissance.&quot; ''Antiques Digest''. 1899. http://www.oldandsold.com/articles27n/french-art-4.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this time that [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] started renovations on Fontainebleau, the former medieval hunting lodge of the French monarchs, just to the southeast of Paris. On April 28, 1528, Le Breton signed a contract with the king to pull down the old entrance tower and erect another, along with several smaller towers and galleries. Le Breton was next contracted to construct the Chapel of St. Saturnin and renovate a staircase in August 1531. He was promised 18,000 livres for work on the grand staircase, per a contract in March 1540. [[Philibert de l'Orme]], the architect of Francis I, acknowledged and verified Le Breton’s works later in 1540. Though de l'Orme became the lead architect of Fontainebleau in 1548, it is believed that Le Breton remained on the project until his death.

Surviving works of Le Breton's at Fontainebleau include the Porte Dorée and loggia,&lt;ref&gt;''A dictionary of architecture and landscape architecture'', James Stevens Curl, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the Cour Ovale, the Cour du Cheval Blanc, and the chapel of La Trinité.&lt;ref&gt;''A dictionary of architecture and building'', Russell Sturgis, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Breton died in the village of [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne]], Fontainebleau, in 1553.

'''Andrea Palladio''' ({{IPA-it|anˈdrɛːa palˈlaːdjo}}; 30 November 1508&amp;nbsp;– 19 August 1580) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;/&gt; architect active in the [[Republic of Venice]]. Palladio, influenced by [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], primarily by [[Vitruvius]], is widely considered to be the most influential individual in the [[Architectural history|history of architecture]]. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura|The Four Books of Architecture]]'', gained him wide recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladio.html His conception of classical architecture was heavily influenced by Vitruvian ideas and his mentor Trissino. &quot;Andrea Palladio.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Vicenza]] and the [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Biography==
Palladio was born on 30 November 1508 in [[Padua]] and was given the name, Andrea Di Pietro della Gondola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Houghton Mifflin dictionary of biography |page=1167 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn=0-618-25210-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfesntdNnbwC&amp;lpg=PA1167&amp;pg=PA1167#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Pietro, called &quot;Della Gondola&quot;, was a miller. From early on, Andrea Palladio was introduced into the work of building. In Padua he gained his first experiences as a stonecutter in the sculpture workshop of Bartolomeo Cavazza da Sossano, who is said to have imposed particularly hard working conditions. At the age of sixteen he moved to Vicenza where he would reside for most of his life. Here he became an assistant in the Pedemuro studio, a leading workshop of stonecutters and masons. He joined a guild of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was employed as a stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures. These sculptures reflected the [[Mannerist]] style of the architect [[Michele Sanmicheli]].

Perhaps the key moment that sparked Palladio's career was being employed by the Humanist poet and scholar, [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], from 1538 to 1539. While Trissino was reconstructing the Villa Cricoli, he took interest in Palladio's work. Trissino was heavily influenced by the studies of Vitruvius, who later influenced Palladio's own ideals and attitudes toward classical architecture. As the leading intellectual in Vicenza, Trissino stimulated the young man to appreciate the arts, sciences, and Classical literature and he granted him the opportunity to study Ancient architecture in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;He visited Rome alongside Trissino in 1541, 1547, and 1554 until 1556. His earlier visits to Rome influenced his designs of palaces. He modeled his designs based on his interpretation of classical architecture he had witnessed. Curl, James Stevens, &quot;A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture&quot;, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Trissino who gave him the name by which he became known, Palladio, an allusion to the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of wisdom [[Athena|Pallas Athene]] and to a character of a play by Trissino. Indeed, the word Palladio means ''Wise one''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How I Spent A Few Days in Palladio's World&quot; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 3 March 2009, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123603460173214171.html?mod=article-outset-box WSJ.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After Trissino's death in 1550, Palladio benefited from the patronage of the Barbaro brothers, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Daniele Barbaro]], who encouraged his studies of [[classical architecture]] and brought him to Rome in 1554, and his younger brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]]. The powerful Barbaros introduced Palladio to [[Venice]], where he finally became &quot;Proto della Serenissima&quot; (chief architect of the Republic of Venice) after [[Jacopo Sansovino]]. In addition to the Barbaros, the Corner, [[Foscari]], and [[Pisani family|Pisani]] families supported Palladio's career.&lt;ref&gt;''Venice and the Renaissance&quot;, Manfredo Tafuri, trans. Jessica Levine, 1989, [[MIT Press]], p.127 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7BYaBnsP5PMC Books.Google.com] ISBN 0-262-70054-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio began to develop his own architectural style around 1541. The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]], named after him, adhered to classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] principles he rediscovered, applied, and explained in his works.&lt;ref&gt;Palladio knew relatively little about Greek architecture, not yet rediscovered at his times, but he studied deeply the Roman remains during five trips to Rome. His works are heavily influenced by his studies of Greco-Roman architecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio is known to be one of the most influential architects in Western architecture. His architectural works have &quot;been valued for centuries as the quintessence of High Renaissance calm and harmony&quot; (Watkin, D., ''A History of Western Architecture''). He designed many palaces, [[villa]]s, and churches, but Palladio's reputation, initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Burns]], [http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&amp;sezione=4&amp;lingua=e ''Andrea Palladio (1508–1580)''], [[Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[palladian villas]] are located mainly in the [[province of Vicenza]], while the ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' are concentrated in the city of [[Vicenza]] and the churches in [[Venice]]. A number of his works are now protected as part of the [[World Heritage Site]] ''[[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]]''. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the ''Venice and its Lagoon'' World Heritage Site.

Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for building the [[loggia]]s for the town hall, known as the [[Basilica Palladiana]], were approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two-storey stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while using classical proportions. The construction was completed in 1617 after Palladio's death.

Aside from Palladio's designs, his publications contributed to ''[[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]]''. During the second half of his life, Palladio published many books, above all, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (''The four books of architecture'', Venice, 1570). Palladio is most known for his designs of villas and palaces as well as his books.

The precise circumstances of his death are unknown. Palladio died in 1580,&lt;ref name=&quot;Avcioglu2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr Nebahat Avcioglu|title=Architecture, Art and Identity in Venice and its Territories, 1450–1750: Essays in Honour of Deborah Howard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOL9i4VXrtkC&amp;pg=PA150|date=23 December 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-1082-5|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; retold in tradition, in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], near [[Treviso]], and was buried in the church of [[Santa Corona]] in Vicenza; since the nineteenth century his tomb has been located in the ''Cimitero Maggiore'' of Vicenza.

Palladio's architecture was not dependent on expensive materials, which must have been an advantage to his more financially pressed clients. Many of his buildings are of brick covered with [[stucco]]. Stuccoed brickwork was always used in his villa designs in order to portray his interpretations of the Roman villa typology.

In the later part of his career, Palladio was chosen by powerful members of Venetian society for numerous important commissions. His success as an architect is based not only on the beauty of his work, but also for its harmony with the culture of his time. His success and influence came from the integration of extraordinary aesthetic quality with expressive characteristics that resonated with his client's social aspirations. His buildings served to communicate, visually, their place in the social order of their culture. This powerful integration of beauty and the physical representation of social meanings is apparent in three major building types: the urban palazzo, the agricultural villa, and the church.

Relative to his trips to Rome, Palladio developed three main palace types by 1556. In 1550, the [[Palazzo Chiericati]] was completed. The proportions for the building were based on musical ratios for adjacent rooms. The building was centralized by a tripartite division of a series of columns or colonnades. In 1552, the [[Palazzo Porto|Palazzo Iseppo Porto]] located in Vicenza was rebuilt incorporating the Roman Renaissance element for façades. A colonnade of Corinthian columns surrounded a main court. The [[Palazzo Antonini]] in Udine, constructed in 1556, had a centralized hall with four columns and service spaces placed relatively toward one side. He uses styles of incorporating the six columns, supported by pediments, into the walls as part of the façade. This technique had been applied in his villa designs as well. Palladio experimented with the plan of the Palazzo Iseppo Porto by incorporating it into the [[Palazzo Thiene]]. It was an earlier project from 1545 to 1550 and remained uncompleted due to elaborate elevations in his designs. He used Mannerist elements such as stucco surface reliefs and large columns, often extending two-stories high.

In his urban structures he developed a new improved version of the typical early [[Renaissance]] palazzo (exemplified by the [[Palazzo Strozzi]]). Adapting a new urban palazzo type created by [[Bramante]] in the [[House of Raphael]], Palladio found a powerful expression of the importance of the owner and his social position. The main living quarters of the owner on the second level were clearly distinguished in importance by use of a [[pediment]]ed classical [[portico]], centered and raised above the subsidiary and utilitarian ground level (illustrated in the [[Palazzo Porto]] and the [[Palazzo Valmarana]]). The tallness of the portico was achieved by incorporating the owner's sleeping quarters on the third level, within a [[Giant order|giant]] two-story classical colonnade, a motif adapted from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Capitoline]] buildings in Rome. The elevated main floor level became known as the &quot;[[piano nobile]]&quot;, and is still referred to as the &quot;first floor&quot; in Europe.

[[File:Palladio lato.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Palladio in Vicenza]]
Palladio also established an influential new building format for the agricultural villas of the Venetian [[aristocracy]]. Palladio's approach to his villa designs was not relative to his experience in Rome. His designs were based on practicality and employed few reliefs. He consolidated the various stand-alone farm outbuildings into a single impressive structure, arranged as a highly organized whole, dominated by a strong center and symmetrical side wings, as illustrated at [[Villa Barbaro]]. In the project of the Villa Barbaro, Palladio most likely was also engaged in the interior decoration. Alongside the painter [[Paolo Veronese]], he invented the complex and sophisticated illusionistic landscape paintings that cover the walls of various rooms.&lt;ref&gt;For the illusionistic landscape paintings and the relationship of Palladio and Veronese see http://www.kunstgeschichte-ejournal.net/329/1/Paolo_Veronese%2C_Andrea_Palladio_und_die_Stanza_di_Baco.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Villa Rotonda]] of 1552, outside Vicenza, was constructed as a summer house with views from all four sides. The plan has centralized circular halls with wings and porticos expanding on all four sides. Palladio began to implement the classical temple front into his design of façades for villas. He felt that to make an entry appear grand, the Roman temple front would be the most suitable style. The Palladian villa configuration often consists of a centralized block raised on an elevated [[podium]], accessed by grand steps, and flanked by lower service wings, as at [[Villa Foscari]] and [[Villa Badoer]]. This format, with the quarters of the owners at the elevated center of their own world, found resonance as a prototype for Italian villas and later for the country estates of the British nobility (such as [[Lord Burlington]]'s [[Chiswick House]], Vanbrugh's [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]], Walpole's [[Houghton Hall]], and Adam's [[Kedleston Hall]] and [http://www.paxtonhouse.co.uk/ Paxton House] in Scotland). His villas were used by a capitalist gentry who developed an interest in agriculture and land. The configuration was a perfect architectural expression of their worldview, clearly expressing their perceived position in the social order of the times. His influence was extended worldwide into the [[British colonies]]. Palladio developed his own prototype for the plan of the villas that was flexible to moderate in scale and function. The Palladian villa format was easily adapted for a democratic worldview, as may be seen at [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and his arrangement for the [[University of Virginia]]. It also may be seen applied as recently as 1940 in Pope's [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington D.C., where the public entry to the world of high culture occupies the exalted center position. The [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] of exposed [[basement]] walls of Victorian residences is a late remnant of the Palladian format, clearly expressed as a podium for the main living space for the family.

Similarly, Palladio created a new configuration for the design of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] churches that established two interlocking architectural orders, each clearly articulated, yet delineating a hierarchy of a larger order overriding a lesser order. This idea was in direct coincidence with the rising acceptance of the theological ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], who postulated the notion of two worlds existing simultaneously: the divine world of faith, and the earthly world of humans.  Palladio created an architecture which made a visual statement communicating the idea of two superimposed systems, as illustrated at [[San Francesco della Vigna]]. In a time when religious dominance in Western culture was threatened by the rising power of science and [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], this architecture found great favor with the Catholic Church as a clear statement of the proper relationship of the earthly and the spiritual worlds.

==Influence==
[[File:Palladio Titel 1642.jpg|thumb|upright|The front page of ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture)]]

[[File:Frontispiece Campbell's edition of Palladio's First Book of Architecture 1728.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] from [[Colen Campbell]]'s edition of Palladio's ''First Book of Architecture'', published at London, 1728]]

Although his buildings are all in a relatively small part of Italy, Palladio's influence was far-reaching. One factor in the spread of his influence was the publication in 1570 of his architectural treatise, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture), which set out rules others could follow. The first book includes studies of decorative styles, classical orders, and materials. The second book included Palladio's town and country house designs and classical reconstructions. The third book has bridge and basilica designs, city planning designs, and classical halls. The fourth book included information on the reconstruction of ancient Roman temples. Before this landmark publication, architectural drawings by Palladio had appeared in print as illustrations to [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s &quot;Commentary&quot; on [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Clini &quot;Vitruvius' Basilica at Fano: The drawings of a lost building from 'De Architectura Libri Decem'&quot; The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Vol. XXXIV, Part 5/W12 pp121 – 126 2002 [http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf ISPRS.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in his style was renewed in later generations and became fashionable throughout Europe, for example in parts of the [[Loire Valley]] of France. In Britain, [[Inigo Jones]], [[Elizabeth Wilbraham]], and [[Christopher Wren]] embraced the Palladian style. In his [[Italian Journey]], [[Johann von Goethe]] describes Palladio as a genius, commending his unfinished Convent of Saint Maria della Carita as the most perfect existing work of architecture. Another admirer was the architect, [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], 4th [[Earl of Cork]], also known as [[Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], who, with [[William Kent]], designed [[Chiswick House]]. The influence of Palladio even spread to America. [[Thomas Jefferson]] loved that style of architecture and the United States Capitol building is an example of a slightly evolved version of Palladio's works. The One Hundred Eleventh [[Congress of the United States of America]] called him the &quot;Father of American Architecture&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcadoc.it/english/news/Palladio-Father-of-American-Architecture.htm The US Congress: 'Palladio, the Father of American Architecture'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (Congressional Resolution no. 259 of 6 December 2010). Exponents of Palladianism include the eighteenth century [[Venice|Venetian]] architect, [[Giacomo Leoni]], who published an authoritative four-volume work on Palladio and his architectural concepts.

More than 330 of Palladio's original drawings and sketches still survive in the collections of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx Collecting Palladio's drawings], website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of which originally were owned by Inigo Jones. Jones collected a significant number of these on his Grand Tour of 1613–1614, while some were a gift from [[Henry Wotton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx Inigo Jones], website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a nonprofit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio's influence in the architecture of the United States.

In 2010, the [[National Building Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] created an exhibition dedicated solely to Palladio and his legacy. The exhibition, titled ''Palladio and His Legacy: A Transatlantic Journey'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/palladio-and-his-legacy.html&lt;/ref&gt; was open to the public until January 2011.

'''Anthonis van Obbergen''' (Antonius, Anthonis, Anthony, Antonie, Anton - Obberghen, Oberberg, Opbergen) (1543 in [[Mechelen]] &amp;ndash; 1611 in [[Gdańsk]]) was a [[Southern Netherlands|Flemish]] architect and fortifications  engineer. After studying masonry in Mechelen and completing a tour to study fortification work in Germany, he initially gained experience working on the fortifications of [[Antwerp]] (1567–71).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisWeilbach.do?kunstnerId=9766&amp;wsektion=alle Anthonis van Obbergen.

==Achievements in Denmark==

In [[Denmark]], he is remembered for his exceptional work on the [[Kronborg|Royal Palace of Kronborg]] in [[Helsingør]] (1577–86) which he completed after another Flemish architect, [[Hans Hendrik van Paesschen|Hans van Paeschen]], resigned from the project in 1577.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O1-OpbergenAntoniusvan.html Antonius van Opbergen from Encyclopedia.com].

Retrieved 1 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the Flemish Renaissance style of [[Antwerp]] developed by [[Cornelis Floris]], the building quickly gained international fame, both as an architecturally imposing building and as the largest castle in northern Europe. Although most of it was destroyed by fire in 1629, [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] had it rebuilt in accordance with van Obbergen's design. Today's castle has not changed substantially since that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roughguides.com/website/Travel/Destination/content/default.aspx?titleid=101&amp;xid=idh638688968_0135 Kronborg Slot and the Maritime Museum.

In 1585, under [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederik II]], van Obbergen replaced the tower of the [[Kullen Lighthouse]] in the [[Öresund]]. The area is now part of [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aladdin.st/oresund/fyrar/fyrar.html Lighthouses in Öresund.] Retrieved 2 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hercules von Oberberg''' (1517–1602) was a Dutch-Danish [[renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] architect. He was mainly active in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]].

==Biography==
In his early years Hercules von Oberberg worked for [[Johann of Brandenburg-Küstrin]] but on 17 July 1557 he became Royal Building Master, succeeding [[Martin Bussert]], but he only stayed in the position for two years. During that time he worked on [[Copenhagen Castle]] and [[Koldinghus]] (minor renovations), [[Sønderborg Castle]] (planning and commenced rebuilding), the [[Fortifications of Copenhagen]] and [[Kronborg|Krogen]] (the bastioned fortifications).

On 29 August 1559 he was employed by Duke [[Hans the Elder]] in [[Haderslev]] where he stayed until his death. In 1559-60 he directed the extension of [[Hansborg]] with two new wings and a tower. During Duke Hans' last years he was also responsible for the reconstruction and fortification of [[Tønderhus]]. In 1591 he worked on [[Gottorf Castle]], where he is credited for the gables of the northern wing.

In 1598 [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] charged von Oberberg, by then an oldman, with the huge tower and castle church at Koldinghus.

==Aftermath==
Introduced the [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt|Floris style]] in Denmark, seen today at Sønderborg Castle, which he transformed from a Medieval fortress into a Renaissance castle for [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. The style is particularly characteristic of the castle church. It was also seen in the gables of Sønderborg Castle and Gottorp Castle's northwing as well as thouse of Tønderhus and Tønning Palace.As a military architect von Oberberg was fairly old-fashioned, relying mainly on Direr's theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-sonderjylland.dk/SIDERNE/Museerne/Bymuseet-i-Haderslev/05-Hercules.html|title=Hercules von Oberberg – en renæssancearkitekt i Hertugdømmet Slesvig

'''Hans van Steenwinckel the Elder''' (c. 1550 – 10 May 1601) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]]-[[Denmark|Danish]] [[architect]] and [[sculptor]]. He worked on a large number of the most important Danish buildings of his time, although the exact scope of his contributions in many cases remains uncertain and much have been demolished or redesigned later. The father of [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger]] and [[Lorenz van Steenwinckel]], he also founded a dynasty of architects and sculptors in Denmark.

==Biography==
Hans van Steenwinckel was born in [[Antwerpen]] c. 1550. The family fled to [[Emden]], [[East Frisia]], where his father, Lourens van Steenwinckel, became master builder. later city architect, and designed the Town Hall from 1567 onwards, later destroyed during [[World War II]]. Hans van Steenwinckel trained under his father, and it is known that he received payment for a design for the Town Hall's stairs and tower in 1574.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1578 he travelled to Denmark, most likely as one of the master bricklayers which his countryman [[Anthonis van Obbergen]] invited to Denmark to assist him building [[Frederick II of Denmark|Fredericj II]]'s [[Kronborg Castle]] at [[Helsingør|Elsinore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Ren%C3%A6ssance/Hans,_d.%C3%A6._van_Steenwinckel|title=Hans van Steenwinckel|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hans only worked on Kronborg for around a year before he, with royal permission, went on the island of [[Hven]] to work for the destinguished astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]], who had for life been granted the island by the King as well as funds for the construction of a house and observatory on the premises. Hans van Steenwinckel probably worked both on [[Uraniborg]] and the subsequent [[Stjerneborg]] observatory, both of which were demolished after Brahe's death in 1601. From 1585 he lived and worked in Copenhagen but his presence on Hven is documented several times in the 1580s and last in 1590. He studied theoretical renaissance architecture and Brahe taught him both astronomy and geometry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1582 he had been named Royal Building Master and in the 1580s he designed [[Slangerup Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Ren%C3%A6ssance/Hans,_d.%C3%A6._van_Steenwinckel|title=Hans van Steenwinckel|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked on a number of churches in Copenhagen, including  [[St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen|St. Peter's Church]] and possibly also the towers at the Churches of Saint Nicolai and the [[Church of the Holy Ghost, Copenhagen|Church of the Holy Ghost]] although this remains uncertain.

Hans van Steenwinckel  also built and rebuilt a number of manor houses around the country, including [[Berritzgaard]], [[Näsbyholm Castle|Näsbyholm]] and Orebygård.

In 1588 the new King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] appointed him Government Architect and from this date his main task was to modernize the fortifications in many Danish towns and strongholds in Sweden and Norway. These included [[Bohus Fortress]], [[Varberg]], [[Halmstad]] and [[Akershus]]. He was also responsiple for the lay out of the completely new town of [[Kristianopel|Christianopel]]. According to his gravestone he was himself most proud of the fortifications of Halmstad, where he died in 1601 and is buried at St. Nicolai's Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Roding| first1 = Juliette| title = The North Sea and culture (1550-1800| url = http://books.google.com/?id=XeDxJ0g5AokC&amp;pg=PA99| accessdate = 2009-12-21| year = 1996| publisher = Hilversum : Verloren,| isbn = 978-90-6550-527-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón''' (1500–1577) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Renaissance architecture|architect of the Renaissance]].

He was born at [[Rascafría]]. His work alternated the late gothic with the renaissance style. His workings include  the Palace of Monterrey in [[Salamanca]], the [[Palace of Guzmanes]] in León, and the facade of the [[Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso]] at the [[University of Alcalá de Henares]]. He also worked in Arzobispo Fonseca College and in the Convent of San Esteban, both in Salamanca and in the Cathedral of Ciudad Rodrigo.

He was the son of the [[Trasmiera#Master masons of Trasmiera|Trasmeran mason]] named [[Juan Gil de Hontañón]], Rodrigo continued the works in the cathedrals of Salamanca and [[Segovia]], both begun by his father in Gothic style.

Gil de Hontañón died at [[Segovia]] in 1577. His personal style has influenced the work of modern architects such as [[Antonio Palacios]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1734">'''Pedro Machuca''' (born Toledo, Spain ca. 1490; died 1550) is mainly remembered as the [[Spain|Spanish]] architect responsible for the design of the [[Palace of Charles V]] (begun 1528) adjacent to the Alcazar in [[Granada]]. The significance of this work is that it represents likely the first major classic [[Renaissance]] style building in Spain. Culturally, it represents the urge by the conquering Christians to challenge the hegemony of [[Moorish architecture]] in the recently (1492) [[Battle of Granada|acquired]] [[province of Granada]].

The details of his life are poorly known. Born in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], he is said to have been a pupil or friends with [[Michelangelo]] and [[Pontormo]]. Returning to Spain in 1520, he worked as a painter in the [[Royal Chapel of Granada]], as well as in [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], Toledo, and Uclés.

With his nephew, the architect Gaspar de Vega, he worked on the vanished Palace of Valsaín and [[Torre de la Parada]]. In 1540 he designed the upper story of the &quot;Patio de las Doncellas&quot; (Courtyard of the Maidens) in the [[Alcázar of Seville]].

He also worked on a number of manor houses including the Palace de Dueñas in Medina del Campo, and the [[Francisco de los Cobos y Molina|Francisco de los Cobos]] Palace in Valladolid (the [[Valladolid Royal Palace]]).

[[File:MEDALLON DE JUAN DE CASTILLO.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Juan de Castillo]]
'''João de Castilho''' (1470–1552), also known as ''Juan de Castillo'',  was a [[Crown of Castile|Castiliian]] and a notable  [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] architect born in Castillo Siete Villas, actually Arnuero ([[Cantabria]]). He is recognizably one of the premier architects in [[Portugal|Portuguese]] history (where he developed most of his work), responsible for several buildings classified as world heritage by UNESCO.

==Career==
He began working on the Cathedral in Bruges, before advancing to the Cathedral of Seville in his early career. From Seville he was summoned by the Archbishop of Braga, D. Diego de Sousa, in 1509, to work on the chapel of the [[Braga Cathedral|Sé Catheral]]

Following this period, he worked on the parochial Church of São João Baptista in [[Vila do Conde]], where he lived for a while (a city was thriving at the time economically due to imports-exports from its port.  

From Vila do Conde, João de Castilho began on working in the Convent of Christ in Tomar. There he executed the celebrated gate and portico to the Church, responding to the beautiful [[Manueline]] window produced by Diogo de Arruda. His efforts were rewarded, when he was given the task of managing the public works at the Convent, which he maintained until his death. 

In 1517, he succeeded Diogo Boitaca as director of the public works at the Monastery of the Jeronimos, where he designed the extraordinary southern portico (along with Gil Vicente, author of the ''Custódia of Belém'').

He worked in five [[World Heritage Sites]]:
* [[Convent of Christ (Tomar)]]
* [[Jerónimos Monastery]]
* [[El Jadida]]
* [[Batalha Monastery]] 
* [[Alcobaça Monastery]].

'''Pierre Lescot''' (c. 1510 &amp;ndash; September 1578&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Berty, &quot;Pierre Lescot et sa famille&quot; ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'' '''6''' (1860) pp 340-48 offered the scant details of Lescot's life.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[France|French]] [[architect]] active during the [[French Renaissance]], &quot;the man who was first responsible for the implantation of pure and correct classical architecture in France.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Thomson, &quot;A Note on Pierre Lescot, the Painter&quot; ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''120''' No. 907 (October 1978, pp. 666-667) p 666; see Henri Zerner, ''L'art de la Renaissance en France. L'invention du classicisme'' (Paris: Flammarion) 1996. Lescot is much less known as a painter, though Thomson identifies a remark of [[Jean Bodin]] that placed one of the sieur de Clagny's paintings in the royal collection at &quot;[[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontaine Beleau]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lescot was born in Paris, France . [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] of France took him into his service, and appointed him architect in charge of the building projects at the [[Palais du Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;The contract is of 1551. The project is analyzed in the context of Parisian urbanism in David Thomson, ''Renaissance Paris: Architecture and Growth, 1475-1600'' (Berkeley: University of California Press) 1984, figs. 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt; which transformed the old château into the palace that we know. A project put forward by the Italian architect and theorist [[Sebastiano Serlio]] was set aside in favor of Lescot's, in which three sides of a square court were to be enclosed by splendid apartments, while on the east, facing the city as it then was, the fourth side was probably destined to be lightly closed with an arcade. Festive corner pavilions of commanding height and adorned by pillars and statues were to replace the medieval towers. Elsewhere in the Louvre, little was actually achieved beyond razing some of the old feudal structure.

[[File:P1080714 Louvre escalier rwk.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Henri II staircase at the north end of the [[Lescot Wing]] of the Louvre]]

Though Lescot was confirmed in his position after the king's death by his heir [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], and though he worked at the Louvre project until his death, only the west side and part of the south side were completed, comprising the present southwest wing of the ''Cour Carré'', the ''[[Aile Lescot]]'', or &quot;Lescot Wing&quot; (''illustration'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/goujon/1_carree.html Cour Carrée illustration].&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the building was executed from 1546 to 1551 set the mold of French classicism: it is of two stories with an attic richly embellished with [[Jean Goujon]]'s panels of bas-reliefs; it is crowned by a sloping roof, a traditional feature of French building and practical in a rainy climate. The deeply recessed arch-headed windows of the ground story give the impression of an arcade, while the projecting central and end [[pavilion]]s bear small round ''oeil de boeuf'' windows above them. In the second storey slender fluted [[pilaster]]s separate the windows, which alternate delicate triangular and arched pediments.  Goujon's noble sculpture and architectural ornaments are cleverly subordinated to the construction, but the surviving groundfloor ''Salle des Caryatides'' (1546&amp;ndash;49) is named for Goujon's four [[caryatid]] figures that support the [[musicians' gallery]]. Of Lescot's constructions at the Louvre there also remain the ''Salle des Gardes'' and the Henry II staircase.

[[Image:FontaineDesInnocents01.jpg|thumb|Lescot's ''Fontaine des nymphes'' 1549, rededicated as ''[[Fontaine des Innocents|Fontaine des innocents]]'']]

His first achievements (1540&amp;ndash;45) were the rood-screen in [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]], of which only some sculptures by Goujon have been saved and in Paris the Hôtel de Ligneris (1548&amp;ndash;50, now the [[Musée Carnavalet]], which was thoroughly altered by [[François Mansart]]). Here and especially in the design of the [[Fontaine des Innocents|Fountain of Nymphs]] (1547&amp;ndash;49, ''illustration, right''), his moderate tectonic role is outshone by Goujon's sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Fontaine des nymphes'' replaced an ancioent public fountain for the entry of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] into Paris, 1549.It stood against a wall; when it was rearranged in 1788 as a free-standing fountain, [[Augustin Pajou]] sculpted a fourth face. ([http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/O0010343.html Insecula]).&lt;/ref&gt; He was also responsible for the [[Château de Vallery]].

Lescot's career is so scantily documented it is not known whether he ever visited Italy, or whether his knowledge of Italian practice was derived through the architecture and engravings that issued from the [[School of Fontainebleau]]. All of Lescot's known works have sculptural decoration by Trebatti and by [[Jean Goujon]], who collaborated with him at the Louvre. Unlike the other architects of the French Flamboyant Gothic and Renaissance, Pierre Lescot was not from a line of masons, with practical experience, but the son of a seigneur. His father, also Pierre Lescot, was sieur of [[Canton of Brie-Comte-Robert|Lissy-en-Brie]] and [[Château de Clagny|Clagny]], not far from Versailles, seigneuries that his son Pierre inherited.  Although, according to a eulogistic poem by [[Pierre Ronsard|Ronsard]],&lt;ref&gt;Ronsard's poem, ''Discours à Pierre Lescot'', was written in 1555 and subsequently modified (Thomson 1978:667).&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Lescot busied himself zealously in early youth making drawings and paintings, and, after his twentieth year, with mathematics and architecture, his wealth and the duties of his offices appear subsequently to have interfered with his artistic activity. No other documented works are identified, though a dismissive reference in the memoires of the [[duc de Nevers]], published long afterwards, instances &quot;Magny&quot; (i.e. Clagny) as &quot;a painter who used to make inventions of masquerades and tourneys&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;un Peintre qui souloit&lt;!--souloit is correct here--&gt; faire des inventions pour les masquerades &amp; tournois nommé Magny, resident à Paris...&quot;'', noted in Thomson 1978:667 and note.&lt;/ref&gt; as all court architects were expected to produce in the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries.

At his death, Lescot was succeeded at the Louvre by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau]].

'''Ridolfo &quot;Aristotele&quot; Fioravanti''' (born c. 1415 or 1420 in [[Bologna]]; died  c. 1486) was an [[Italian Renaissance]] architect and engineer, active in [[Muscovy]] from 1475, where he designed the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow]] during 1475&amp;ndash;1479.

His surname is sometimes given as '''Fieraventi'''.  Russian versions of his name are Фиораванти, Фьораванти, Фиеравенти, Фиораванте.

==Biography==
Little is known about Fioravanti's early years. He was born in [[Bologna]] around 1415/1420 to a family of architects and hydraulic engineers.

He became renowned for the very innovative devices he used for the rebuilding of [[Towers of Bologna|the towers]] belonging to the noble families of the city. Between 1458 and 1467 he worked at [[Florence]] for [[Cosimo de' Medici]] the Elder and at [[Milan]], before returning to his native city. Here he created the plans for the [[Palazzo Bentivoglio, Bologna|Palazzo Bentivoglio]], but the edifice was not finished (by [[Giovanni II Bentivoglio]]) until 1484-1494. In 1467 he worked for king [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]] in [[Hungary]].

In 1475 at the invitation of [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] he went to [[Moscow]], where he built the magnificent [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition Cathedral]]  during from 1475&amp;ndash;1479,&lt;ref&gt;Mark M. Jarzombek, Vikramaditya Prakash and Francis D.K. Ching, ''A Global History of Architecture'', (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2011), 544.&lt;/ref&gt; taking inspiration from the [[Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir|Dormition Cathedral]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. This is the work for which he is best remembered.

According to some accounts, he was thrown into prison by Ivan III when he asked to return to [[Italy]], and died in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Anna M. Lawton, ''Imaging Russia 2000: Film and Facts'', (New Academia Publishing, 2004), 257.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to other accounts, he participated as a military engineer and artillery commander in the campaigns against [[Novgorod]] (1477-1478), [[Kazan]] (1482) and [[Tver]] (1485).&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Paul, &quot;The Military Revolution in Russia 1550-1682,&quot; ''The Journal of Military History'' (Jan. 2004):9-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pinczow 20060722 1429.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Anne's Chapel]] in Pińczów]]

==Biography==
He moved to Poland after 1550, most probably from [[Florence]], and became the court artist of king [[Sigismund II Augustus of Poland]], his queen consort [[Anna Jagiellonka]] and his successor [[Stefan Batory of Poland]]. Santi Gucci's workshop in [[Pińczów]] became a notable school which attracted many future artists and became one of the centres of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] art and culture in [[Poland]]. For his merits for the Polish crown he was ennobled, accepted into the ranks of the [[szlachta]] and given a [[Zetynian Coat of Arms]].

One of the most successful and fruitful artists of his epoch, Gucci built or reconstructed a number of palaces of notable people in all parts of [[Rzeczpospolita|the Polish Republic]]. Among them was the [[Firlej]] family castle in [[Janowiec]] on the [[Vistula]] (1565–1585), for whom he also sculpted a Mannerist tomb in a local parish church (ca. 1586). For the [[Piotr Myszkowski (bishop)|Piotr Myszkowski]] family he erected a new palace in [[Książ Wielki]] (1585–1595), [[Mirów Castle in Książ Wielki|Mirów Castle]]. He also erected the [[Krowodrza#Krowodrza|Łobzów]] palace (1585–1587), in [[Kraków]], and expanded the castle in [[Pińczów]] (1591–1600). He is also supposed to be the architect of the [[Pińczów synagogue]].

One of his most notable works is the integral design and funerary monuments in the [[Bartolommeo Berrecci]]'s Sigismund's Chapel in the [[Wawel Cathedral]]. The chapel, often referred to as the ''pearl of Italian Renaissance north of the Alps'', housed the graves of King [[Sigismund Augustus of Poland]] and [[Anna Jagiellonka]]. Between 1594 and 1595 he also refurbished the Mariacka Chapel to house the tomb of [[Stefan Batory]]. Others among his major works include the [[Branicki (Gryf) family|Branicki]] family chapel in [[Niepołomice]] (1596) and [[St Anne's Chapel|St. Anne's Chapel]] in [[Pińczów]].

'''Hans Hendrik van Paesschen''' (c. 1510-1582) was a [[Flemings|Flemish]] [[architect]], based in [[Antwerp]], who designed high-style classical buildings in many [[country|countries]] of northern [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Curl, James Stevens. ''A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, 2nd Ed.'' Oxford: Oxford UP, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and Times==
While [[Italy]] was blessed with the [[architecture]] of [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[France]] with that of [[Philibert Delorme]], a contemporary of theirs, Hans Hendrik van Paesschen, was designing equally beautiful buildings in northern Europe. One of the reasons he is so little known is that in each country where he worked his name was spelled differently.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Paesschen, Hans Hendrik van.&quot; [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O1-PaesschenHansHendrikvan.html Encyclopedia.com] Accessed 16 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After presumably receiving his training in Italy, Paesschen established himself in [[Antwerp]] as architect and builder, often using the sculptor [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt]] to secure architectural [[Contract|commissions]] for him. Paesschen worked in [[Flanders]], the [[Netherlands]], [[England]], [[Wales]], north [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Königsberg]]. It is also likely that he designed buildings in northeastern [[France]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], but these have so far not been identified.

In sharp contrast to the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] and [[mannerist]] styles being used at the time in northern Europe, Paesschen often designed buildings in a pure [[Florence|Florentine]] style, but with a northern flavor. He employed arcaded and colonnaded [[loggia]]s, [[dome]]s, and [[Venice|Venetian]] [[arch]]es on his best buildings. Unfortunately, the majority of his buildings have been destroyed or substantially altered, so his work is known mostly through old pictures. Several generations of his descendants in the [[Van de Passe family]] were notable [[engraver]]s, usually with the surname de Pas or van de Passe.{{Cn|date=July 2015}}

'''Robert Smythson''' (1535–1614) was an [[England|English]] [[architect]]. Smythson designed a number of notable houses during the [[Elizabethan]] era. Little is known about his birth and upbringing&amp;mdash;his first mention in historical records comes in 1556, when he was [[stonemason]] for the house at [[Longleat]], built by [[John Thynne|Sir John Thynne]] (ca. 1512-1580). He later designed [[Hardwick Hall]], [[Wollaton Hall]], [[Burton Agnes Hall]], and other significant projects. Historically, a number of other Elizabethan houses, such as [[Gawthorpe Hall]] have been attributed to him on stylistic grounds.

In Britain at this time, the profession of architect was in its most embryonic stage of development. Smythson was trained as a stonemason, and by the 1560s was travelling England as a master mason leading his own team of masons. In 1568 he moved from London to Wiltshire to commence work on the new house at Longleat for Sir [[John Thynne]]; he worked there for almost eighteen years, carving personally much of the external detail, and he is believed to have had a strong influence on the overall design of the building. In 1580 he moved to his next project&amp;mdash;Wollaton Hall. At Wollaton he was clearly more a &quot;surveyor&quot; (the term at that time for an architect) than a stonemason, and was in charge of overall construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Girouard]], ''Hardwick Hall'', The National Trust, 2006. ISBN 1-84359-217-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Smythson's style was more than a fusion of influences; although [[Renaissance]], especially [[Sebastiano Serlio]], [[Flanders|Flemish]] and [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]] notes can be seen in his work, he produced some ingenious adaptations, resulting in classically detailed, innovative domestic buildings. Hardwick in particular is noted for its use of [[glass]].

Smythson died at Wollaton in 1614 and is buried in the parish church there; his memorial includes these words &quot;Architecter (sic) and Surveyor unto the most worthy house of Wollaton with divers others of great account.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Mark Girouard, ''Robert Smythson &amp; the Elizabethan Country House'' 1983; pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; His son John Smythson ([[Bolsover Castle]]) and grandson Huntingdon Smithson (as he spelt the family name) were also architects.

{{See also|Antoine Bullant|l1=Jean Bullant (composer)}}

'''Jean Bullant''' (1515 &amp;ndash; 13 October 1578) was a [[France|French]] [[architect]] and [[sculpture|sculptor]] who built the tombs of [[Anne de Montmorency]], Grand Connétable of France, [[Henry II of France|Henri II]], and [[Catherine de' Medici]]. He also worked on the [[Tuileries]], the [[Louvre]], and the [[Château d'Écouen]]. Bullant was a [[Huguenot]].

==Career==
On his return in 1537 from study in Rome, Bullant worked for Montmorency, for whom he transformed the [[Château d'Écouen]] about 1550, built the  &quot;petit château&quot; at [[Château de Chantilly|Chantilly]], and modernised the Château de Fère-en-Tardenois, with its splendid bridge.

He took up the ongoing works at the [[Tuileries]] upon the death of [[Philibert Delorme]] (1570), and was appointed royal architect, (1571–78). At [[Château de Chenonceaux|Chenonceaux]] he built the gallery that spans the river on arches (1576–1577). For [[Catherine de Médicis]] he built the [[Hôtel de Soissons]], (1572–84; demolished in 1748), of which only the ''[[Medicis column]]'' remains.

His treatise on architecture, ''La Règle générale d'architecture sur les cinq manières de colonnes'', was published at Paris, 1564 and 1568. Bullant was also the author of treatises linking theory to practice, on geometry for craftsmen (''Petit Traicté de géometrie et horlogiographie pratique'', 1564), and horology, notably quadrants and solar clocks (''Recueil d'Horlogiographie'', 1561).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13846">'''Antonio di Pietro Averlino''' (c. 1400 – c. 1469), also &quot;Averulino&quot;, known as '''''Filarete''''' (from φιλάρετος, Greek for &quot;lover of excellence&quot;), was a [[Florentine Renaissance]] [[architect]], [[sculpture|sculptor]], [[medallist]], and architectural theorist. He is perhaps best remembered for his design of the ideal city of [[Sforzinda]], the first ideal city plan of the Renaissance.

==Biography==
Antonio di Pietro Averlino was born c. 1400 in [[Florence]] where he probably trained as a craftsman. Sources suggest that he worked in Florence under the Italian painter, architect, and biographer [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], who gave him his more famous name “Filarete” which means “a lover of virtue”. In the mid 15th century, Filarete was expelled from [[Rome]] after being accused of attempting to steal the head of [[John the Baptist]] and he moved to [[Venice]] and then eventually to [[Milan]]. There he became a ducal engineer and worked on a variety of architectural projects for the next fifteen years. According to his biographer, [[Vasari]], Filarete died in Rome c. 1469.&lt;ref&gt;'Il Filarete.' ''International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture.'' St. James Press, 1993.

===Bronze doors of Old St. Peter's Basilica===
A commission granted by [[Pope Eugene IV]] meant that Filarete, over the course of twelve years, cast the [[bronze]] central doors for [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]], which were completed in 1445.&lt;ref&gt;Ghiberti's great bronze doors for the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery of Florence]] preceded this In the following century, Filarete's doors were preserved when Old St Peter's was demolished and they were later reinstalled in the new [[St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were created during the Renaissance, the doors have distinct Byzantine influences and seem tied to the Medieval era. Some critics have noted that the doors offer a glimpse into the mind of Filarete, claiming that they show his “mind of medieval complexity crammed full of exciting but not quite assimilated classical learning”.&lt;ref&gt;Roeder, Helen. 'The Borders of Filarete's Bronze Doors to St. Peters'. ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', Vol. 10, (1947), pp. 150-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural works===
[[Image:Milano Castello 1.jpg|150pz|thumb|Milan]][[Image:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|Filarete: ''Sforzinda'']]
In Milan Filarete built the [[Ospedale Maggiore]] (c. 1456), the overall form of which was rationally planned as a cross within a square, with the hospital church centrally-planned, at the center of the plan. Some of the surviving sections of the much-rebuilt structure show the Gothic detail of Milan's ''[[quattrocento]]'' craft traditions, which are at odds with Filarete's design ''all' antica'' or 'after the Antique' (Murray 1963). Filarete also worked on the [[Castello Sforzesco]] or Sforza Castle and on the [[Duomo di Milano]] or Milan Cathedral.

===Filarete's treatise on Architecture and the ideal city of Sforzinda===
Filarete completed his substantial book on architecture sometime around 1464, which he referred to as his ''Libro architettonico'' (&quot;Architectonic book&quot;).  Neither he nor his immediate contemporaries ever referred to it as a ''Trattato'' (&quot;Treatise&quot;), though it is usually now called such.  The ''Libro'', which comprises twenty-five volumes, enjoyed a fairly wide circulation in manuscript form during the Renaissance. The most well known and best preserved copy of the ''Libro'' is a profusely illustrated manuscript known as the ''Codex Magliabechiano'' (probably drafted c. 1465; now held in the archives of the [http://www.bncf.firenze.sbn.it Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze]). The fact that the ''Codex Magliabechiano'' is dedicated to [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and was conserved in Florence suggests that Filarete was well regarded in his native Florence despite his loyalty to Milan. The book, which is written as a fictional narrative, consists principally of a detailed account of the technical aspects of architecture (e.g., site and material selection, drawing, construction methods, and so on) and a sustained polemic against the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] of Northern Italy, which Filarete calls the &quot;barbarous modern style.&quot; Filarete argues instead for the use of [[Romanesque architecture|classical Roman]] models.

The most famous part of his book is his plan for Sforzinda, an [[ideal city]] named after [[Francesco Sforza]], then Duke of Milan.  Although Sforzinda was never built, certain aspects of its design are described in considerable detail. The basic layout of the city is an eight-point star, created by overlaying two squares so that all the corners were equidistant. This shape is then inscribed within a perfect circular moat. This shape is iconographic and probably ties to Filarete’s interest in magic and astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, Spiro. ''The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings.'' London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with ''Quattrocento'' or fifteenth century notions concerning the talismanic power of geometry and the crucial importance of astrology, Filarete provides, in addition to pragmatic advice on materials, construction, and fortifications, notes on how to propitiate celestial harmony within Sforzinda. His architectonical drawings and even more his allegorical drawings traced on the margins of the Codex Magliabechianus - such as the Allegory of Vertue and the Allegory of the Reason and Will - Filarete shows a remarkable possession of classical sources, maybe known also through the advice of his friend Francesco Filelfo da Tolentino, the main humanist then at the court of Milan.&lt;ref&gt;P. Coen, &quot;La allegoria della Virtù di Antonio Averlino, detto il Filarete&quot; in Le due Rome del Quattrocento, ed. S. Rossi and S. Valeri, Rome, 1994; P. Coen, Il problema della Ragione e della Volontà: il contributo di un'allegoria di Antonio Averlino, detto il Filarete&quot;, in Arte Lombarda, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of planning, each of the outer points of the star had towers, while the inner angles had gates. Each of the gates was an outlet of radial avenues that each passed through a market square, dedicated to certain goods. All the avenues finally converged in a large square which was centrally located. The town contained three squares – one for the prince’s palace, one for the cathredal, and one for the market. Because the Renaissance was much taken with the idea of the canal town, in Filarete's Sforzinda every other street had a canal for cargo transport.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The canal system also connected with the river, and thus the outside world, for the import and export of goods. The city also contained many buildings, including parishes and separate schools for boys and girls. An example of a building that appears in the treatise is Filarete’s House of Vice and Virtue, a ten-story structure with a brothel on the bottom and an academy of learning on the higher levels. Filarete did much study on representation of Vices and Virtues, and there are suggestions that his radial design for the city was inspired by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]’s Earthly City, whose circular shape was divided into sections, each of which had its own Vice and Virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S. 'The Ideal City from Plato to Howard', ''Architectural Review'' 112. Aug. 1952, pp 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of Sforzinda may have been in part a direct response to the Italian cities of the Medieval period, whose growth did not necessarily depend on city planning as such, which meant they could be difficult to navigate.&lt;ref&gt;Madanipour, Ali. ''Designing the City of Reason: Foundation and Frameworks.'' New York: Routledge, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In part, the Renaissance humanist interest in classical texts may have stimulated preoccupations with geometry in city layouts, as for example, in [[Plato]]'s description of [[Atlantis]]. Filarete’s ideal plan was meant to reflect on society – where a perfect city form would be the image of a perfect society, an idea that was typical of the humanist views prevalent during the High Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance ideal city implied the centralized power of a prince in its organization, an idea following closely on the heels of [[Dante]]’s that “The human race is at its best under a monarch.”&lt;ref&gt;Alighieri, Dante. ''De Monarchia'', c. 1312&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it could be argued that the Renaissance ideal city form was tensioned between the perceived need for a centralized power and the potential reality of tyranny.

==Influence on Architecture and Urbanism==
Filarete's plan of Sforzinda was the first ideal city plan of the Renaissance and his thorough organization of its layout embodied a greater level of conscious city planning than anyone before him. Despite the many references to medieval symbolism incorporated into Sforzinda's design, the city's principles became the archetype for the humanist city during the High Renaissance. The treatise gained interest from many important leaders such as Giangaleazzo Sforza and [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]] and later when [[Francesco di Giorgio]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] began to plan their ideal cities they borrowed ideas from Filarete.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Il Filarete.&quot; ''International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture.'' St. James Press, 1993. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009. http://0-galenet.galegroup.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/servlet/BioRC&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was never built, Sforzinda served as an inspiration for many future city plans. For example, in the 16th century, Renaissance military engineers and architects combined Filarete's ideal city schemes with defensive fortifications deriving from a more sociopolitical agenda. This notion of combining the ideal and the fortified city became widely disseminated throughout Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works attributed to him==

Filarete is one of many Renaissance figures regarded as a possible author of the [[Voynich manuscript]]. This thesis is supported by claimed similarities between drawings of architecture in the VMS and in his other works, as well as by scientific dating of the manuscript's velum to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciphermysteries.com/2012/05/07/national-geographic-ancient-x-files-voynich-manuscript-documentary&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Güstrow Schloss vom Park.jpg|thumb|[[Güstrow Castle]] designed by Franciscus Pahr]]
'''Franciscus Pahr''' (died 1580) was an Italian architect{{sfn|Campbell|2009|p=37}} who worked in [[Silesia]] and [[Sweden]] from the 1550s. He is remembered above all for his work in [[Uppsala]] where he contributed to the [[Uppsala Cathedral|cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Castle|castle]].&lt;ref name=hs&gt;[http://www.historiesajten.se/visainfo.asp?id=600 &quot;Franciscus Pahr&quot;], Historiesajten. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 3 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He refurbished the Upsala castle completely after the fire of 1572. Pahr was from a family of architects who worked in Germany and Sweden during the later part of 16th century and were instrumental in introducing [[Renaissance architecture]] to northern Europe. One of the first projects in this genre in Germany was Pahr's work at Uppsala.&lt;ref name=Pahr&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ne.se/sok?q=Franciscus|title= Pahr|accessdate=5 October 2013|language=Swedish|publisher=National Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Pahr was almost certainly the son of master builder Jacob Pahr from Milan and the brother of Johan Baptista Pahr, Christoffer Pahr and Dominicus Pahr. Pahr was described to have &quot;come from Milan via Brieg, Güstrow and Rostock&quot;.{{sfn|Ehrensvärd|2006|p=187}} The Pahr family brought Italian and German [[Renaissance architecture]] to Sweden. In the 1550s, together with his father and Dominicus, Pahr contributed to building the Silesian [[Brzeg Castle]] of [[Brzeg]] and supervised the construction of fortifications at [[Rostock]] and [[Schwerin]]. He probably also built the Castle of Löwenberg (now [[Lwówek Śląski]]).&lt;ref name=ra&gt;[http://www.nad.riksarkivet.se/SBL/Presentation.aspx?id=7939 &quot;Franciscus Pahr&quot;], Riksarkivet. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 3 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1558, he entered into an agreement with [[Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow|Duke Ulrich of Mecklenburg-Güstrow]] to build a castle in [[Güstrow]],{{sfn|Hahr|1938|p=30}} which he supervised until 1565. He used brick as the main building material.&lt;ref name=ra/&gt;

In 1572, [[King Johan III]] of Sweden invited Pahr and his older brother Domenicus Pahr (''de Pari''), to build the Upsala castle. After the castle's fire, Pahr was retained to rebuild it as Domenicus had become sick; he oversaw the rebuilding process in 1572.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahr1938&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=August Hahr|title=Architecture in Sweden: a survey of Swedish architecture throughout the ages and up to the present day|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Lqgy2bAXAh0C|year=1938|publisher=Printed by A.

In 1578, he supervised work on the restoration of [[Uppsala Cathedral]] which had also been damaged by the 1572 fire, reconstructing the towers in the Renaissance style. In August 1580, Pahr died before completing this assignment.&lt;ref name=hs/&gt;&lt;ref name=ra/&gt;

His son, Dominicus Pahr, was a German architect.{{sfn|Wikland|1962|p=192}}

== Biography ==
Willem de Keyser was a son of the prominent Amsterdam architect [[Hendrick de Keyser]]. He was the brother of architect [[Pieter de Keyser]] (1595-1676), sculptor [[Hendrick de Keyser II]] (the Younger; 1613-1665), and painter [[Thomas de Keyser]] (c. 1596-1667).

Around 1623 he left Amsterdam to settle in [[London]], where he found employment with his brother-in-law, the English architect [[Nicholas Stone]], who had married Willem's sister Maria. Stone had been charged with the construction of a number of buildings in classical style designed by [[Inigo Jones]] for King [[Charles I of England]]. During his stay in England, De Keyser married Walburga Parker. He remained in England until 1640, when the turbulent English political situation forced him to return to Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=&quot;nnw&quot;&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu02_01/molh003nieu02_01_1306.php P.C.

Sijthoff, Leiden 1912] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 1640 he was accepted as a master into the Amsterdam [[masonry|masons']] [[guild]], and on 3 December 1647 the city government appointed him master mason of the city (''stadsmeestersteenhouwer''). He assisted [[Jacob van Campen]] in designing and building Amsterdam's grand new town hall (now the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]]) as well as the [[spire]] of the adjacent [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] church.&lt;ref name=&quot;nnw&quot; /&gt;

On 20 February 1653 he was dismissed from his post as city mason on charges of fraud. De Keyser was alleged to have altered invoices and paid salaries to persons who were not actually employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nnw&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/oudholland16docugoog/oudholland16docugoog_djvu.txt A.W. Weissman, &quot;Symon Bosboom&quot;, ''Oud-Holland'', Vol. 25, Nr. 1, pp. 1-8, 1907] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; Van Campen nevertheless requested his services as a sculptor for the monumental tomb of [[Maarten Tromp]] in [[Delft]]'s [[Oude Kerk (Delft)|Oude Kerk]] church and the tomb of [[Jan van Galen]] in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. &lt;ref name=&quot;oudeennieuwekerkdelft&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nieuwekerk&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nnw&quot; /&gt;

In 1658 he declared bankruptcy and left again for England. He was still living in England in 1674. He must have returned to Amsterdam not long thereafter, as he was working in 1678 on a monumental tomb for [[Michiel de Ruyter]] in the Nieuwe Kerk, over which he brought a case to court in 1680. It is not know when and where he died.&lt;ref name=&quot;nnw&quot; /&gt;

'''Cornelis Floris''' or '''Cornelis (II) Floris De Vriendt''' (1514 &amp;ndash; 20 October 1575) was a [[Southern Netherlands|Flemish]] [[sculptor]], [[Engraving|print artist]] and [[architect]] whose new style informed by Flemish traditions and the 16th century [[Italian renaissance]] spread throughout Northern Europe where it had a major influence on the development of sculpture and architecture in the 16th and early 17th centuries.

==Life==
Cornelis Floris II was born around the year 1514 as the eldest of the four sons of Cornelis I and Margarete Goos. The earliest known ancestors of the Floris de Vriendt family, then still called only ‘de Vriendt’, were residents of [[Brussels]] where they practiced the craft of stonemason and stonecutter which was passed on from father to son.  One of Cornelis' ancestors became in 1406 a master of the [[Brussels]] stonemasons guild.  A family member, Jan Florisz. (abbreviation of Floriszoon, meaning Floris’s son) de Vriendt, left his native Brussels and settled in Antwerp in the mid 15th century.  His patronymic name ‘Floris’ became the common family name of the subsequent generations.  The original form ‘de Vriendt’ can, however, still be found in official documents until the late 16th century.&lt;ref name=ox1&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028690 Carl Van de Velde. &quot;Floris.&quot;] Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 30 Jan. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eglise Saint-Léonard de Léau 06.JPG|thumb|Tabernacle in the St. Leonard's Church, Zoutleeuw]]
Little is known about his training.  He probably worked in the workshop of his father who was a stonemason.  He traveled abroad and was reportedly in Italy when his father died in 1538. He then returned to Antwerp to take care of his mother and younger brothers.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T028690pg1 Carl Van de Velde. &quot;Cornelis Floris II.&quot;] Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 6 Feb. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1539 he became a master in the local [[Guild of Saint Luke]].&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[http://explore.rkd.nl/explore/artists/28384 Biographical details] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He served as the dean of the Guild in 1547 and 1559.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; At around 1540 the guild register was embellished with [[grotesque]] initials which were signed by Cornelis. These grotesque motives, that were inspired by Italian contemporary models which in turn were based on archeological finds in Rome, would become an important characteristic of the Floris style and were used by him (as well as his brother [[Frans Floris|Frans]]) in his other works.&lt;ref name=arc&gt;[http://books.google.com.hk/books?id=P9MjVxeQS34C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=%22Cornelis+Floris%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YIXzUsm3I8fNkQX6_YCoDg&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cornelis%20Floris%22&amp;f=false Rutger Tijs, Renaissance- en barokarchitectuur in België’], Lannoo Uitgeverij, 1999 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1550 Floris married Elisabeth Machiels and bought a house in Antwerp that he renovated in his own style.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

Cornelis Floris II died on 20 October 1575 after a rich career. At the beginning of his career the renaissance was just starting to appear in the Netherlands. By the time he died the new style was firmly established in the Netherlands. This was, however, not a simple copy of the Italian example as artists like Floris had imbued the style with homegrown sensibility.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt;

Cornelis' brothers also became excellent artists.  The most famous one is Frans, who was one of the leading Flemish [[mannerist]] painters while Jacob was a painter of stained-glass windows and Jan was a potter.&lt;ref name=ox1/&gt;

Cornelis had many pupils, a number of whom became established artists in their own right.  They included [[Willem van den Blocke]], [[Gert van Egen]], Gillis de Witte, Philip Brandin, Robert Coppens, Heinrich Hagart and Hieronymus van Kessel (I).&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

==Works==
Cornelis Floris was a versatile artist.  He was mainly active as architect and sculptor, but also worked as an engraver.
[[File:Tournai Kathedrale2.JPG|thumb|300px|Marble [[Rood Screen]] with stations of the cross, in [[Tournai Cathedral]]]]

===Sculpture===
As a sculptor he is principally known for his work on funeral monuments.  In 1549 he received the commission for a funeral monument to be placed in [[Königsberg Cathedral]] for [[Dorothea of Denmark, Duchess of Prussia|Dorothea]], the wife of [[Albert, Duke in Prussia]] and daughter of the Danish king [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codart.nl/news/965/ C. Osiecki, 'Rediscovered Cornelis Floris bust in The Pushkin Museum Moscow']&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the beginning of many commissions for sepulchral monuments for members of the Danish royal family.  These included the tomb of Albert, Duke in Prussia in Königsberg Cathedral, the mausoleum of King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] of Denmark and the Cenotaph of Frederick I in [[Schleswig Cathedral]]. The monuments were typically made in marble with the statue of the deceased executed in [[alabaster]].

In his home country he created in 1522 for the [[St. Leonard's Church, Zoutleeuw|St. Leonard's Church]] in [[Zoutleeuw]] a stone tabernacle in the form of an 18-meter-high, nine-level tower. The tower made of white Avesnes stone was shipped in parts from Floris’ workshop in Antwerp to the church. This work still incorporates gothic elements.  He created another tabernacle for the St. Catherina Church in Zuurbeemde (now part of [[Glabbeek]]) in 1555-1557 which is in a pure renaissance style. He also made the [[rood screen]] for the [[Tournai Cathedral|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in [[Tournai]] and the tomb monument of Jean II de Mérode in the Saint Dymphna Church in [[Gheel]].&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;
This sequence of major assignments points to a large workshop with a fair number of employees. Cornelis Floris acted mainly as an organizer and planner.  His pupils and assistants travelled to the various locations (usually in Northern Europe) where the monuments designed by Floris were to be installed.  Many of them remained to live and work in Northern Europe where they set up their own workshops.  They relied on the Floris network to find their own commissions while often also continuing to assist with the execution of designs of Floris in their place of residence.  Some of these artists, such as Willem van den Blocke and Gert van Egen, became artists working for the local court and were instrumental in the spread of the Floris style in Northern Europe.&lt;ref name=os&gt;[http://ezine.codart.nl/17/issue/45/artikel/forgotten-netherlandish-artists-in-the-baltic-region-the-migration-of-dutch-and-flemish-sculptors-to-the-baltic-region-in-the-second-half-of-the-sixteenth-century/?id=115#!/page/1 C. Osiecki, 'Forgotten Netherlandish Artists in the Baltic Region: the migration of Dutch and Flemish sculptors to the Baltic region in the second half of the sixteenth century', CODART eZine 2, Spring 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[Image:stadhuis.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Antwerp city hall]]

From the late 1550s Cornelis Floris was additionally active as a designer of buildings. He is listed among others as architect of the [[Antwerp City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/cityhalls/antwerp_cityhall.htm Jan Lampo, ''Antwerp City Hall'']&lt;/ref&gt; There are divergent views on the precise role of Cornelis Floris in the design of the building and its construction, as it was a collaborative effort which involved a great number of architects and sculptors including, amongst others, [[Willem van den Broeck]], [[Hans Hendrik van Paesschen]] and [[Jan Daems]]. His contribution was not restricted to collaboration in the design. It is certain that he also had an important role in the practical execution.&lt;ref name=arc/&gt; He visited quarries to choose stone and at that time maintained a large workshop in the [[Everdijstraat]] with a dozen assistants who were mainly busy with work related to the construction of the city hall. Their activity likely focused on the sculptures for the interior and the facade.

The Antwerp City Hall became a figurehead for the new renaissance style in architecture in the Netherlands. The city halls of [[Vlissingen]] and [[The Hague]] in the Netherlands and the design of the city hall of [[Emden]], the portico of the [[Cologne]] City Hall (1557) in Germany and the [[Green Gate]] in [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]] were inspired by this new style.

Cornelis Floris also designed in Antwerp the Hanseatic League building and the town house of his brother Frans (1562–5).  Both buildings no longer exist.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;

===Graphic art===
Floris collaborated with engraver and publisher [[Hieronymus Cock]] in the publishing of books with his designs for monuments and ornaments: the ‘’Veelderley niewe inuentien van antycksche sepultueren’’ (‘The many new designs of antique sculptures') was published in 1557 and the ‘’Veelderley veranderinghe van grotissen’’ (‘Many varieties of grotesques’) in 1556.

The publication of these books contributed to the spread of his style throughout the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6184">[[Image:Delorme.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraved portrait of Philibert de l'Orme, c. 1626]]
'''Philibert de l'Orme''' ({{IPA-fr|filibɛːʁ dəlɔʁm|pron}}) (3–9 June 1514 &amp;ndash; 8 January 1570) was a [[France|French]] [[architect]] and writer,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann 1996; Pérouse de Montclos 2000, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the great masters of the [[French Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1958, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; His surname is also written '''De l'Orme''', '''de L'Orme''', or '''Delorme'''.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Lyon]], the son of Jean de L'Orme, a master mason.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann 1996; Potié 1996, p. 23 (&quot;Il semble probable que cette stratégie d'ascension sociale ait été préparée de longue date par Jean de L'Orme qui savait que seule la hiérarchie ecclésiastique permettrait à un fils de maître-maçon d'espérer conquérir un statut plus enviable.&quot;). Jean is the modern spelling of Jehan.&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age Philibert was sent to [[Italy]] to study (1533&amp;ndash;1536) and was employed there by [[Pope Paul III]]. Returning to France he was patronized by [[Cardinal du Bellay]] at Lyon, and was sent by him about 1540 to [[Paris]], where he began the [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés|Chateau de St Maur-des-Fossés]], and enjoyed royal favour; in 1545 he was made architect to [[Francis I of France]] and given the charge of works in [[Brittany]].
[[Image:Israel SilvestrePartieStGermain.jpg|thumb|left|350px|[[Israel Silvestre]]'s view of the uppermost terrace of the Château Neuf at Meudon shows (with artistic license) its neglected state a century later.]]
In 1548, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] gave him the supervision of [[Chateau Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]&amp;mdash;where he built the Château Neuf (''illustration, left'') &amp;mdash; and the other royal buildings; but on the King's death (1559) Philibert fell into disgrace. Under [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], however, he returned to favour, and was employed to construct the [[Tuileries]], in collaboration with [[Jean Bullant]]. He died in Paris.

Much of his work has disappeared, but his fame remains. An ardent [[Humanism|humanist]] and student of the antique, he yet vindicated resolutely the French tradition in opposition to Italian tendencies; he was a man of independent mind and a vigorous originality. His masterpiece was the [[Château d'Anet]] (1552&amp;ndash;1559), built for [[Diane de Poitiers]], the plans of which are preserved in [[Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]]'s ''Plus excellens bastimens de France'', though part of the building alone remains; and his designs for the Tuileries (also given by Androuet du Cerceau), begun by [[Catherine de' Medici]] in 1565, were magnificent. His work is also seen at [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]] and other famous ''[[château]]x''; and his tomb of Francis I at [[Saint Denis Basilica]] remains a perfect specimen of his art. He wrote two books on architecture: ''Nouvelles inventions pour bien bastir et à petits frais'' (1561) and ''Le premier tome de l'Architecture'' (1567).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4871">'''Giovan Antonio Rusconi''' (* 1515 or 1520; † 1579) was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[architect]], [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]], translator and illustrator of [[Vitruvius]].

== Life ==
[[File:Della architettvra (1590) (14769861931).jpg|thumbnail|''Della Architettvra''. Illustration.]]
Apart from being introduced into building and painting young Antonio Rusconi studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Padua]] under [[Giovanni Battista Memmo]] and [[Niccolò Tartaglia]]. Extensively consulting Vitruvius’ [[De architectura|&quot;Ten Books on Architecture&quot;]] while he was constructing a novel type of [[watermill]] Antonio became aware of many grave technical errors within the work’s early Renaissance editions and commentaries. Finally [[Pietro Lauro]], who had rendered [[Leon Battista Alberti|Leon Battista Alberti’s]] “De Architectura” into the vernacular, convinced Rusconi to set out with a translation of his own. The text was finished until 1552 and illustrated with more than three hundred supplementary [[woodcut]]s. Earlier, Rusconi had already provided the illustrations for [[Lodovico Dolce|Lodovico Dolce’s]] version of the [[Metamorphoses|Ovidian “Metamorphoses”]].
Yet, since then countless treatises on architecture and commentaries on [[Vitruvius]] (e.g. by [[Daniele Matteo Alvise Barbaro|Daniele Barbaro]], [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Gicaomo Vignola]] and [[Andrea Palladio]]) were being published, Rusconi’s Venetian editors, [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]] and [[Tommaso Porcacchi]], saw no benefit in printing another title on the subject.
Together with [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]] Rusconi draughted the [[Brescia#Piazza della Loggia|&quot;Palazzo municipale&quot; (Brescia)]] in 1562, they also took part in rebuilding the [[Doge's Palace]] after the fire of 1577 and constructing the [[Palazzo Grimani di Santa Maria Formosa|Palazzo Grimani]]. Nevertheless throughout his life Rusconi’s main occupation was that of a [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic engineer]] for the [[Republic of Venice]]. After having fallen gravely ill in 1575 Giovan Antonio died in 1579.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Anna Bedon, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi: illustratore di Vitruvio, artista, ingegnere, architetto'', in: ''Della Architettura di Gio''[van]''Antonio Rusconi'', Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio di Vicenza, Testi e fonti per la storia dell’architettura, Verona, Vicenza 1996, pp. IX–XXI; Louis Cellauro, ''La biblioteca di un architetto del Rinascimento la raccolta di libri di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi'', in: Arte Veneta 58 (2001), pp. 224–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rusconi's &quot;Della Architettura&quot; ==
Rusconi’s “Vitruvius” was only printed after his death in 1590 by the son of his former editor [[:de:Gabriele Giolito de’ Ferrari|Giolito]]. Although the latter recognised the value of Giovan Antonio’s [[woodcut|xylographies]] he considered his translation and annotations as outdated, and thus a strange “Vitruvius without Vitruvius“ was published:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bedon 1996, p. XII: „questa strana edizione vitruviana senza Vitruvio, senza traduzione, senza autore.“&lt;/ref&gt; Just about 160 of originally 300 [[woodcut]]s were compiled with extracts from [[Giovanni Giocondo|Fra Giocondo’s]] and [[Cesare Cesariano|Cesariano’s]] translations of [[De architectura|Vitruvius’ treatise]]. For many of Rusconi’s illustrations containing references to textual explanations, it is particularly regrettable that his translation has hence been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Reiser, ''Giovan Antonio Rusconi (1515/20–1579)'', in: ''Firmitas et Splendor. Vitruv und die Techniken des Wanddekors'', ed. by Erwin Emmerling, [[:de:Andreas Grüner|Andreas Grüner]] et al., Munich 2014 (Studien aus dem Lehrstuhl für Restaurierung, [[Technische Universität München]], Fakultät für Architektur) ISBN 978-3-935643-62-7, pp. 269-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci''' ({{IPA-it|leoˈnardo di ˌsɛr ˈpjɛːro da (v)ˈvintʃi|lang|it-Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci.ogg}}), more commonly '''Leonardo da Vinci''' or simply '''Leonardo''' (15 April 1452{{snds}}2 May 1519), was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[polymath]] whose areas of interest included [[invention]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[architecture]], [[science]], [[music]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]], [[literature]], [[anatomy]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]], [[writing]], [[history]], and [[cartography]]. He has been variously called the father of [[paleontology]], [[ichnology]], and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the [[parachute]], [[helicopter]] and [[tank]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn White 1968, 466&quot;&gt;{{harnvb|White|1968|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flight-1&quot;&gt;Rumerman, Judy.

For this reason, even though it uses words such as &quot;archetype,&quot; &quot;greatest,&quot; and &quot;most,&quot; it does not contravene Wikipedia policies, as it states how Leonardo has been professionally described and regarded for 500 years. It also cites eight references which support these statements. --&gt;

Many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the &quot;[[Universal Genius]]&quot; or &quot;Renaissance Man&quot;, an individual of &quot;unquenchable curiosity&quot; and &quot;feverishly inventive imagination&quot;.&lt;ref name=HG&gt;{{cite book |first=Helen |last=Gardner |title=Art through the Ages |year=1970 |pages=450–456}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]], the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and &quot;his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote&quot;.&lt;ref name=HG /&gt; Marco Rosci notes that while there is much speculation regarding his life and personality, his view of the world was logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unorthodox for his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marco |last=Rosci |title=Leonardo |year=1977 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born [[Legitimacy (law)|out of wedlock]] to a [[notary]], Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, in [[Vinci, Italy|Vinci]] in the region of [[Florence]], Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter [[Andrea del Verrocchio]]. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of [[Ludovico il Moro]] in Milan. He later worked in Rome, [[Bologna]] and [[Venice]], and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded to him by [[Francis I of France]].

Leonardo was, and is, renowned primarily as a painter. Among his works, the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' is the most famous and most parodied portrait&lt;ref&gt;John Lichfield, [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-moving-of-the-mona-lisa-6149165.html &quot;The Moving of the Mona Lisa&quot;], ''The Independent'', 2 April 2005 (accessed 2012-03-09)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' the most reproduced religious painting of all time, their fame approached only by [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''.&lt;ref name=HG /&gt; Leonardo's drawing of the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' is also regarded as a [[cultural icon]],&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvian Man is referred to as &quot;iconic&quot; at the following websites and many others:[http://www.italian-renaissance-art.com/Vitruvian-Man.html Vitruvian Man], [http://artpassions.com/art/1109-Fine-Art-Classics/0000067329-Leonardo-Da-Vinci-Vitruvian-Man.html Fine Art Classics], [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=403230&amp;sectioncode=26 Key Images in the History of Science]; [http://www.ingenious.org.uk/read/identity/bodyimage/Curiosityanddifference/ Curiosity and difference]; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2006/aug/30/art1 &quot;The Guardian: The Real da Vinci Code&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;There are 15 significant artworks which are ascribed, either in whole or in large part, to Leonardo by most art historians. This number is made up principally of paintings on panel but includes a mural, a large drawing on paper and two works which are in the early stages of preparation. There are a number of other works that have also been variously attributed to Leonardo.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.

Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity. He conceptualised flying machines, a type of [[armoured fighting vehicle]]&lt;!--could we have a more specific link-target?--&gt;, [[concentrated solar power]], an [[adding machine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AddingMachine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://192.220.96.166/leonardo/leonardo.html |title=Roberto Guatelli's Controversial Replica of Leonardo da Vinci's Adding Machine |last=Kaplan |first=Erez |year=1996 |accessdate=19 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529140741/http://192.220.96.166/leonardo/leonardo.html |archivedate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[double hull]], also outlining a rudimentary theory of [[plate tectonics]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=March 2016}} Relatively few of his designs were constructed or even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to [[metallurgy]] and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, such as an automated [[bobbin]] winder and a machine for testing the [[tensile strength]] of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. A number of Leonardo's most practical inventions are nowadays displayed as working models at the Museum of Vinci. He made substantial discoveries in [[anatomy]], civil engineering, [[optics]], and [[fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]], but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science.&lt;ref&gt;Capra, pp.5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Leonardo is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived.&lt;ref name=&quot;genius&quot;&gt;See the quotations from the following authors, in section '''Fame and reputation''': Vasari, Boltraffio, Castiglione, &quot;Anonimo&quot; Gaddiano, Berensen, Taine, Fuseli, Rio, Bortolon.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alessandro Vezzosi, head of the Leonardo Museum in Vinci, there is evidence that Piero owned a Middle Eastern slave called Caterina. That Leonardo had Middle Eastern blood is claimed to be supported by the reconstruction of a fingerprint as reported by {{cite news |first=Marta |last=Falconi |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120100961.html |title=Experts Reconstruct Leonardo Fingerprint |date=12 December 2006 |accessdate=6 May 2013 |edition=News |origyear=1 December 2006}} The evidence, as stated in the article, is that 60% of people of Middle Eastern origin share the pattern of whirls found on the reconstructed fingerprint.

Little is known about Leonardo's early life. He spent his first five years in the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Anchiano]] in the home of his mother, and from 1457 lived in the household of his father, grandparents and uncle, Francesco, in the small town of Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young&lt;ref name=&quot;LB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Liana |last=Bortolon |title=The Life and Times of Leonardo |publisher=Paul Hamlyn |publication-place=London |year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1465 without children. When Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Margherita/6000000022836749865 ''Margherita (da Vinci)'' in: geni.com] [retrieved 15 June 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (who bore him another six children:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Lucrezia-Cortigiani/6000000011018546847 ''Lucrezia Cortigiani'' in: geni.com] [retrieved 15 June 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni).&lt;ref&gt;Rosci, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnano&quot;&gt;Magnano, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all Leonardo had twelve half-siblings, who were much younger than him (the last was born when Leonardo was forty years old) and with whom he had very few contacts, but they caused him difficulty after his father's death in the dispute over the inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnano&quot;/&gt;

Leonardo received an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he regarded as an omen, was when a [[Kite (bird)|kite]] dropped from the sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face.&lt;ref&gt;Rosci, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity to find out what was inside.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Leonardo's early life has been the subject of historical conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brigstoke |first=Hugh |title=The Oxford Companion the Western Art |location=Oxford, ENG, UK |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasari]], the 16th-century biographer of Renaissance painters, tells of how a local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the [[Duke of Milan]]. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield decorated with a heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vasari |first=Giorgio |title=Lives of the Artists |year=1568 |publisher=Penguin Classics |pages=258–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verrocchio's workshop, 1466–76 ===
[[File:Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci - Baptism of Christ - Uffizi.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'' (1472{{ndash}}75), [[Uffizi]], by Verrocchio and Leonardo|alt=Painting showing Jesus, naked except for a loin-cloth, standing in a shallow stream in a rocky landscape, while to the right, John the Baptist, identifiable by the cross that he carries, tips water over Jesus' head.

In 1466, at the age of fourteen, Leonardo was apprenticed to the artist Andrea di Cione, known as [[Andrea del Verrocchio|Verrocchio]], whose ''bottega'' (workshop) was &quot;one of the finest in Florence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosci&quot;&gt;Rosci, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; He apprenticed as a ''garzone'' (studio boy) to Andrea del Verrocchio, the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his day.&lt;ref name=&quot;refseek.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refseek.com/data/cache/en/1/Leonardo_da_Vinci.html|title=Leonardo da Vinci – Encarta (cached)|work=refseek.com|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous painters apprenticed or associated with the workshop include [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Perugino]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Lorenzo di Credi]].&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; Leonardo would have been exposed to both theoretical training and a vast range of technical skills,&lt;ref&gt;Rosci, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics and carpentry as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting and modelling.&lt;ref name=AM&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Martindale |year=1972 |title=The Rise of the Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The &quot;diverse arts&quot; and technical skills of Medieval and Renaissance workshops are described in detail in the 12th-century text ''On Divers Arts'' by [[Theophilus Presbyter]] and in the early 15th-century text ''Il Libro Dell'arte O Trattato Della Pittui '' by [[Cennino Cennini]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the painted production of Verrocchio's workshop was done by his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|The Baptism of Christ]]'', painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe in a manner that was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.258&lt;/ref&gt; On close examination, the painting reveals much that has been painted or touched-up over the [[tempera]] using the new technique of [[oil painting|oil paint]], with the landscape, the rocks that can be seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of ''[[David (Verrocchio)|David]]'' in the [[Bargello]] and the [[Archangel Raphael]] in ''[[Tobias and the Angel (Verrocchio)|Tobias and the Angel]]''.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt;

By 1472, at the age of twenty, Leonardo qualified as a master in the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], the guild of artists and doctors of medicine,{{refn|That Leonardo joined the guild before this time is deduced from the record of payment made to the Compagnia di San Luca in the company's register, Libro Rosso A, 1472–1520, Accademia di Belle Arti.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt;|group=nb}} but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen and ink of the [[Arno]] valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;This work is now in the collection of the [[Uffizi]], Drawing No. 8P.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= DA /&gt;

Florentine court records of 1476 show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with [[sodomy]] but acquitted; homosexual acts were illegal in Renaissance Florence.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt; From that date until 1478 there is no record of his work or even of his whereabouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;everything&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Everything Da Vinci Book |first=Shana |last=Priwer |first2=Cynthia |last2=Phillips |year=2006 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1478, he left Verrocchio's studio and was no longer resident at his father's house. One writer, the &quot;Anonimo&quot; Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and working in the Garden of the Piazza San Marco in Florence, a [[Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonic]] academy of artists, poets and philosophers that the [[Medici family|Medici]] had established.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt; In January 1478, he received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]; in March 1481, he received a second independent commission for ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'' for the monks of San Donato a Scopeto.&lt;ref name=Wasser1&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Wasserman |title=Leonardo da Vinci |year=1975 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither commission was completed, the second being interrupted when Leonardo went to Milan.

In 1482, Leonardo, who according to Vasari was a most talented musician,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winternitz |first=Emanuel |title=Leonardo Da Vinci As a Musician |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a silver [[lyre]] in the shape of a horse's head. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] sent Leonardo to Milan, bearing the lyre as a gift, to secure peace with [[Ludovico Sforza]], [[Duke of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rossi |first=Paolo |title=The Birth of Modern Science |year=2001 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Leonardo wrote an often-quoted letter describing the many marvellous and diverse things that he could achieve in the field of engineering and informing Ludovico that he could also paint.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo's Letter to Ludovico Sforza|work= | publisher =Leonardo-History|date= |url=http://www.leonardo-history.com/life.htm?Section=S5|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' for the monastery of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]].&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Kemp |title=Leonardo |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1538)|Hungary]] on behalf of Ludovico to meet [[Matthias Corvinus]], for whom he is believed to have painted a [[Holy Family]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz-Joachim Verspohl, ''Michelangelo Buonarroti und Leonardo Da Vinci: Republikanischer Alltag und Künstlerkonkurrenz in Florenz zwischen 1501 und 1505'' (Wallstein Verlag, 2007), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}} Between 1493 and 1495, Leonardo listed a woman called Caterina among his dependents in his taxation documents.

Leonardo was employed on many different projects for Ludovico, including the preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions, designs for a dome for [[Milan Cathedral]] and a model for a huge [[equestrian statue|equestrian monument]] to [[Francesco Sforza]], Ludovico's predecessor. Seventy tons of [[bronze]] were set aside for casting it. The monument remained unfinished for several years, which was not unusual for Leonardo. In 1492, the clay model of the horse was completed. It surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's ''[[Equestrian statue of Gattamelata|Gattamelata]]'' in Padua and Verrocchio's ''[[Bartolomeo Colleoni]]'' in Venice, and became known as the &quot;''[[Leonardo's horse|Gran Cavallo]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Verrocchio's statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni was not cast until 1488, after his death, and after Leonardo had already begun work on the statue for Ludovico.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo began making detailed plans for its casting;&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; however, Michelangelo insulted Leonardo by implying that he was unable to cast it.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; In November 1494, Ludovico gave the bronze to be used for cannon to defend the city from invasion by [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]].&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

At the start of the [[Second Italian War]] in 1499, the invading French troops used the life-size clay model for the ''Gran Cavallo'' for target practice. With Ludovico Sforza overthrown, Leonardo, with his assistant Salai and friend, the mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]], fled Milan for [[Venice]],&lt;ref name=Chiesa85&gt;della Chiesa, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; where he was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; On his return to Florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the Servite monks at the monastery of [[Santissima Annunziata, Florence|Santissima Annunziata]] and were provided with a workshop where, according to Vasari, Leonardo created the cartoon of ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist]]'', a work that won such admiration that &quot;men and women, young and old&quot; flocked to see it &quot;as if they were attending a great festival&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |In 2005, the studio was rediscovered during the restoration of part of a building occupied for 100 years by the Department of Military Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Owen |title=Found: the studio where Leonardo met Mona Lisa |publisher=The Times |date=12 January 2005 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article411195.ece |accessdate=5 January 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; |group=nb}}

[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - Plan of Imola - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Leonardo da Vinci's very accurate map of [[Imola]], created for [[Cesare Borgia]]]]

In [[Cesena]] in 1502, Leonardo entered the service of [[Cesare Borgia]], the son of [[Pope Alexander VI]], acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron.&lt;ref name=Chiesa85 /&gt; Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of [[Imola]] in order to win his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it would have seemed like a new concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief [[military engineer]] and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of [[Chiana Valley]], Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.

Leonardo returned to Florence where he rejoined the [[Guild of Saint Luke#Italy|Guild of Saint Luke]] on 18 October 1503, and spent two years designing and painting a mural of ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' for the Signoria,&lt;ref name=Chiesa85 /&gt; with Michelangelo designing its companion piece, ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|The Battle of Cascina]]''.{{refn |Both works are lost.

In 1506 Leonardo returned to Milan.

Leonardo did not stay in Milan for long because his father had died in 1504, and in 1507 he was back in Florence trying to sort out problems with his brothers over his father's estate. By 1508 Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila.&lt;ref name=Chiesa86&gt;della Chiesa, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old age, 1513–1519 ===

From September 1513 to 1516, under [[Pope Leo X]], Leonardo spent much of his time living in the [[Cortile del Belvedere|Belvedere]] in the Vatican in Rome, where [[Raphael]] and Michelangelo were both active at the time.&lt;ref name=Chiesa86 /&gt; In October 1515, [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]] recaptured Milan.&lt;ref name=Wasser1 /&gt; On 19 December, Leonardo was present at the meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X, which took place in Bologna.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Goyau, ''François I'', Transcribed by Gerald Rossi.

[[File:Clos luce 04 straight.JPG|thumb|[[Clos Lucé]] in France, where Leonardo died in 1519|alt=Photo of a large medieval house, built of brick with many windows and gables and a circular tower with a conical roof]]

Leonardo died at [[Clos Lucé]], on 2 May 1519. Francis I had become a close friend. Vasari records that the king held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, although this story, beloved by the French and portrayed in romantic paintings by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[:File:DeathOfLeonardo.jpg|Ménageot]] and other French artists, as well as by [[Angelica Kauffman]], may be legend rather than fact.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;On the day of Leonardo's death, a royal edict was issued by the king at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], a two-day journey from [[Clos Lucé]]. This has been taken as evidence that King François cannot have been present at Leonardo's deathbed. However, White in ''Leonardo: The First Scientist'' points out that the edict was not signed by the king.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the [[Holy Sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his will, sixty beggars followed his casket.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;This was a charitable legacy as each of the sixty paupers would have been awarded an established mourner's fee in the terms of Leonardo's will.&lt;/ref&gt; Melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving as well as money, Leonardo's paintings, tools, library and personal effects. Leonardo also remembered his other long-time pupil and companion, Salai and his servant Battista di Vilussis, who each received half of Leonardo's [[vineyard]]s, his brothers who received land, and his serving woman who received a black cloak &quot;of good stuff&quot; with a fur edge.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The black cloak, of good quality material, was a ready-made item from a clothier, with the fur trim being an additional luxury. The possession of this garment meant that Leonardo's house keeper could attend his funeral &quot;respectably&quot; attired at no expense to herself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leonardo's will|work= |publisher=Leonardo-history|date= |url=http://www.leonardo-history.com/life.htm?Section=S6|accessdate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo da Vinci was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert in [[Château d'Amboise]], in France.

Some 20 years after Leonardo's death, Francis was reported by the goldsmith and sculptor [[Benvenuto Cellini]] as saying: &quot;There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture and architecture, as that he was a very great philosopher.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mario |last=Lucertini |first2=Ana Millan |last2=Gasca |first3=Fernando |last3=Nicolo |title=Technological Concepts and Mathematical Models in the Evolution of Modern Engineering Systems |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YISIUycS4HgC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=leonardo+cellini+francois+philosopher |accessdate=3 October 2007 |isbn=978-3-7643-6940-8 |year=2004 |publisher=Birkhäuser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Florence: Leonardo's artistic and social background ===
[[File:Gylleneportarna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Lorenzo Ghiberti's]] ''Gates of Paradise'' (1425{{ndash}}52) were a source of communal pride. Many artists assisted in their creation]]

Florence at the time of Leonardo's youth was the centre of Christian [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] thought and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosci&quot; /&gt; Leonardo commenced his apprenticeship with Verrocchio in 1466, the year that Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor [[Donatello]], died. The painter [[Uccello]], whose early experiments with perspective were to influence the development of landscape painting, was a very old man. The painters [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Filippo Lippi]], sculptor [[Luca della Robbia]], and architect and writer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were in their sixties. The successful artists of the next generation were Leonardo's teacher Verrocchio, [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]] and the portrait sculptor [[Mino da Fiesole]], whose lifelike busts give the most reliable likenesses of Lorenzo Medici's father Piero and uncle Giovanni.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederich |last=Hartt |title=A History of Italian Renaissance Art |year=1970 |pages=127–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosci1&gt;Rosci, ''Leonardo'', chapter 1, ''the historical setting'', pp.9–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruck /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach /&gt;

Leonardo's youth was spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, [[Masaccio]], whose figurative [[fresco]]es were imbued with realism and emotion, and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], whose ''[[Florence Baptistery#Lorenzo Ghiberti|Gates of Paradise]]'', gleaming with [[gold leaf]], displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Piero della Francesca, ''On Perspective for Painting (De Prospectiva Pingendi)''&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti's]] treatise ''[[De Pictura]]''&lt;ref&gt;Leon Battista Alberti, ''De Pictura'', 1435. [http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/ ''On Painting'', in English], [http://www.liberliber.it/mediateca/libri/a/alberti/de_pictura/html/depictur.htm ''De Pictura'', in Latin]&lt;/ref&gt; were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruck /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach /&gt;

Massaccio's &quot;[[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]]&quot; depicting the naked and distraught [[Adam and Eve]] created a powerfully expressive image of the human form, cast into three dimensions by the use of [[chiaroscuro|light and shade]], which was to be developed in the works of Leonardo in a way that was to be influential in the course of painting. The humanist influence of Donatello's &quot;David&quot; can be seen in Leonardo's late paintings, particularly ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]''.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosci1 /&gt;

[[File:Workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, 1470s Metropolitan Museum N-Y.jpg|thumb|right|Small devotional picture by [[Verrocchio]], {{circa|1470}}]]

A prevalent tradition in Florence was the small altarpiece of the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin and Child]]. Many of these were created in [[tempera]] or glazed [[terracotta]] by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific [[Luca della Robbia|della Robbia]] family.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt; Leonardo's early Madonnas such as ''[[Madonna of the Carnation|The Madonna with a carnation]]'' and the ''[[Benois Madonna]]'' followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, particularly in the case of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the opposite angle. This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as ''The [[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo)|Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]''.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Leonardo was a contemporary of [[Botticelli]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Perugino]], who were all slightly older than he was.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt; He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the [[Academy#Modern use of the term academy|Academy]] of the [[Medici]].&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; Botticelli was a particular favourite of the Medici family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. They competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated Ghirlandaio's ability to portray the wealthy citizens of Florence within large religious frescoes, and Perugino's ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt;

[[File:Hugo van der Goes 006.jpg|thumb|left|''The Portinari Altarpiece'', by [[Hugo van der Goes]] for a Florentine family]]

These three were among those commissioned to paint the walls of the [[Sistine Chapel]], the work commencing with Perugino's employment in 1479. Leonardo was not part of this prestigious commission. His first significant commission, The ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for the Monks of Scopeto, was never completed.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

In 1476, during the time of Leonardo's association with Verrocchio's workshop, the [[Portinari Altarpiece]] by [[Hugo van der Goes]] arrived in Florence, bringing from Northern Europe [[Early Netherlandish painting|new painterly techniques]] that were to profoundly affect Leonardo, Ghirlandaio, Perugino and others.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt; In 1479, the Sicilian painter [[Antonello da Messina]], who worked exclusively in oils, traveled north on his way to [[Venice]], where the leading painter [[Giovanni Bellini]] adopted the technique of oil painting, quickly making it the preferred method in Venice. Leonardo was also later to visit Venice.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach /&gt;

Like the two contemporary architects [[Bramante]] and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Elder]], Leonardo experimented with designs for centrally planned churches, a number of which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, pp.391–92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ghirlandaio a-pucci-lorenzo-de-medici-f-sassetti 1.jpg|thumb|Lorenzo de' Medici between Antonio Pucci and Francesco Sassetti, with Giulio de' Medici, fresco by [[Ghirlandaio]]]]

Leonardo's political contemporaries were [[Lorenzo Medici]] (il Magnifico), who was three years older, and his younger brother Giuliano, who was slain in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]] in 1478. Leonardo was sent as an ambassador by the Medici court to [[Ludovico il Moro]], who ruled [[Milan]] between 1479 and 1499.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt;

With Alberti, Leonardo visited the home of the Medici and through them came to know the older Humanist philosophers of whom [[Marsiglio Ficino]], proponent of [[Neo Platonism]]; [[Cristoforo Landino]], writer of commentaries on Classical writings, and [[John Argyropoulos]], teacher of Greek and translator of [[Aristotle]] were the foremost. Also associated with the Academy of the Medici was Leonardo's contemporary, the brilliant young poet and philosopher [[Pico della Mirandola]].&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hugh Ross |last=Williamson |title=Lorenzo the Magnificent |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo later wrote in the margin of a journal, &quot;The Medici made me and the Medici destroyed me.&quot; While it was through the action of Lorenzo that Leonardo received his employment at the court of Milan, it is not known exactly what Leonardo meant by this cryptic comment.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Although usually named together as the three giants of the [[High Renaissance]], Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael were not of the same generation. Leonardo was twenty-three when Michelangelo was born and thirty-one when Raphael was born.&lt;ref name=Rosci1 /&gt; Raphael lived until the age of only 37 and died in 1520, the year after Leonardo died, but Michelangelo went on creating for another 45 years.&lt;ref name=Bruck&gt;{{cite book |first=Gene A. |last=Brucker |title=Renaissance Florence |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rach&gt;{{cite book |first=Ilan |last=Rachum |title=The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal life ===
{{Main article|Personal life of Leonardo da Vinci}}

Within Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his &quot;outstanding physical beauty&quot;, &quot;infinite grace&quot;, &quot;great strength and generosity&quot;, &quot;regal spirit and tremendous breadth of mind&quot;, as described by Vasari,&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One such aspect was his respect for life, evidenced by his vegetarianism and his habit, according to Vasari, of purchasing caged birds and releasing them.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Müntz |first=Eugène |page=17 |url=https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125000944930#page/n47/mode/2up/ |year=1898 |title=Leonardo da Vinci.

[[File:Isabella d'este.jpg|thumb|left|Study for a portrait of [[Isabella d'Este]] (1500) [[Louvre]]]]

Leonardo had many friends who are now renowned either in their fields or for their historical significance. They included the mathematician [[Luca Pacioli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Leonardo_Master_Draftsman/draftsman_left_essay.asp |title=Leonardo, Left-Handed Draftsman and writer |accessdate=18 October 2009 |last=Bambach |first=Carmen |year=2003 |location=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110221047/http://www.metmuseum.org/special/leonardo_master_draftsman/draftsman_left_essay.asp &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he collaborated on the book ''[[De divina proportione]]'' in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with [[Cecilia Gallerani]] and the two Este sisters, [[Beatrice d'Este|Beatrice]] and Isabella.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright Ady, Julia. Beatrice d'Este, Duchess of Milan, 1475–1497. Publisher: J.M. Dent, 1899; Cartwright Ady, Julia. Isabella D'Este, Marchioness of Mantua, 1474–1539. Publisher; J.M. Dent, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; While on a journey that took him through [[Mantua]], he drew a portrait of Isabella that appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Eine Kindheitserinnerung des Leonardo da Vinci'', (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salai and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with [[sodomy]] in an incident involving a well-known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/bera/activities/globe/leonardo_da_vinci.htm |title=How do we know Leonardo was gay?|publisher=Bnl.gov |date=3 May 2001 |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in ''John the Baptist'' and ''Bacchus'' and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rocke, ''Forbidden Friendships'' epigraph, p. 148 &amp; N120 p.298&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The info contained here is beyond dispute.

Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, nicknamed ''[[Salaì|Salai]]'' or ''Il Salaino'' (&quot;The Little Unclean One&quot; i.e., the devil), entered Leonardo's household in 1490. After only a year, Leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours, calling him &quot;a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton&quot;, after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo, Codex C. 15v, Institut of France. Trans. Richter&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo's household for the next thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Salai executed a number of paintings under the name of Andrea Salai, but although Vasari claims that Leonardo &quot;taught him a great deal about painting&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 265&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils, such as [[Marco d'Oggiono]] and [[Boltraffio]]. In 1515, he painted a nude version of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', known as ''[[Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno#Life|Monna Vanna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Tom |title=Mona Lisa Goes Topless |work= |publisher=Paintingsdirect.com |date= |url=http://www.paintingsdirect.com/content/artnews/032001/artnews1.html |accessdate=27 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403073656/http://www.paintingsdirect.com/content/artnews/032001/artnews1.html |archivedate=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salai owned the ''Mona Lisa'' at the time of his death in 1525, and in his will it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{cite web |last=Rossiter |first=Nick |title=Could this be the secret of her smile? |work=Daily Telegraph |date=4 July 2003 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/04/07/banr.xml |accessdate=3 October 2007 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1506, Leonardo took on another pupil, Count [[Francesco Melzi]], the son of a [[Lombardy|Lombard]] aristocrat, who is considered to have been his favourite student. He travelled to France with Leonardo and remained with him until Leonardo's death.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt; Melzi inherited the artistic and scientific works, manuscripts, and collections of Leonardo and administered the estate.

[[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione.jpeg|thumb|400px|''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' (1475{{ndash}}1480){{nsmdns}}[[Uffizi]], is thought to be Leonardo's earliest complete work]]

Despite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter and on a handful of works, either authenticated or attributed to him that have been regarded as among the masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a &quot;Divine&quot; painter. His fame is discussed by Daniel Arasse in ''Leonardo da Vinci'', pp. 11–15&lt;/ref&gt;

These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities which have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. Among the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are the innovative techniques which he used in laying on the paint, his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology, his interest in [[physiognomy]] and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, and his use of the subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the ''Mona Lisa'', the ''Last Supper'' and the ''Virgin of the Rocks''.&lt;ref&gt;These qualities of Leonardo's works are discussed by Frederick Hartt in ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', pp. 387–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early works ===
[[File:Leonardo, san girolamo.jpg|left|thumb|Unfinished painting of ''[[St. Jerome in the Wilderness]]'', ({{c|1480}}), [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]]]

Leonardo's early works begin with the ''[[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Baptism of Christ]]'' painted in conjunction with Verrocchio. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at the workshop, both of which are [[Annunciation]]s. One is small, {{nowrap|{{convert|59|cm}}}} long and {{nowrap|{{convert|14|cm}}}} high. It is a &quot;predella&quot; to go at the base of a larger composition, in this case a painting by [[Lorenzo di Credi]] from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, {{nowrap|{{convert|217|cm}}}} long.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, pp. 88, 90&lt;/ref&gt; In both these Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, such as in Fra Angelico's two well-known pictures of the same subject, of the [[Virgin Mary]] sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.&lt;ref name=Berti&gt;{{cite book |first=Luciano |last=Berti |title=The Uffizi |year=1971 |pages=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the smaller picture, Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to God's will. In the larger picture, however, Mary is not submissive. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise.&lt;ref name=Hartt /&gt; This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the [[Mother of God]], not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.{{refn |Michael Baxandall lists 5 &quot;laudable conditions&quot; or reactions of Mary to the presence and announcement of the angel. These are: Disquiet, Reflection, Inquiry, Submission and Merit. In this painting Mary's attitude does not comply with any of the accepted traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Baxandall |title=Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy |year=1974 |pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; |group=nb}}

=== Paintings of the 1480s ===

[[File:Leonardo da Vinci Virgin of the Rocks (National Gallery London).jpg|thumb|''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'', [[National Gallery]], London, demonstrates Leonardo's interest in nature]]

In the 1480s, Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work which was also of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment. One of these paintings is that of ''[[St. Jerome in the Wilderness]]''. Bortolon associates this picture with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: &quot;I thought I was learning to live; I was only learning to die.&quot;&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and it is very unusual.{{refn|The painting, which in the 18th century belonged to [[Angelica Kauffman]], was later cut up. The two main sections were found in a junk shop and cobbler's shop and were reunited.&lt;ref name=Wasser2 /&gt; It is probable that outer parts of the composition are missing.|group=nb}} [[St Jerome|Jerome]], as a [[penitent]], occupies the middle of the picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to the outer edge of the painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies.&lt;ref name=Wasser2&gt;Wasserman, pp.104–6&lt;/ref&gt; Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.

The daring display of figure composition, the landscape elements and personal drama also appear in the great unfinished masterpiece, the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'', a commission from the Monks of San Donato a Scopeto. It is a complex composition, of about 250 x 250 centimetres. Leonardo did numerous drawings and preparatory studies, including a detailed one in linear perspective of the ruined [[classical architecture]] which makes part of the backdrop to the scene. But in 1482 Leonardo went off to Milan at the behest of [[Lorenzo Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]] in order to win favour with [[Ludovico il Moro]], and the painting was abandoned.&lt;ref name=Chiesa83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berti /&gt;

The third important work of this period is the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' which was commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, to be done with the assistance of the [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis|de Predis brothers]], was to fill a large complex altarpiece, already constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant [[John the Baptist]], in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. In this scene, as painted by Leonardo, John recognizes and worships Jesus as the Christ. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Mysterious Virgin | work = | publisher =[[National Gallery, London]] | url =http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collection/features/potm/2006/may/feature1.htm | accessdate = 27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While the painting is quite large, about {{nowrap|200×120 centimetres}}, it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of St Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished, one which remained at the chapel of the Confraternity and the other which Leonardo carried away to France. But the Brothers did not get their painting, or the de Predis their payment, until the next century.&lt;ref name=DA&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Arasse |title=Leonardo da Vinci |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiesa85&quot; /&gt;

=== Paintings of the 1490s ===
[[File:Última Cena - Da Vinci 5.jpg|thumb|left|400px|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'' (1498){{nsmdns}}[[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Convent of Sta. Maria delle Grazie]], Milan, Italy]]

Leonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]'', painted for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. The painting represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death. It shows specifically the moment when Jesus has just said &quot;one of you will betray me&quot;. Leonardo tells the story of the consternation that this statement caused to the twelve followers of Jesus.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

The novelist [[Matteo Bandello]] observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p.124&lt;/ref&gt; This was beyond the comprehension of the [[prior]] of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.263&lt;/ref&gt;

When finished, the painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation,&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as &quot;completely ruined&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface which was subject to mold and to flaking.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the painting has remained one of the most reproduced works of art, countless copies being made in every medium from carpets to cameos.

=== Paintings of the 16th century ===
[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or ''La Gioconda'' (1503{{ndash}}05/07){{nsmdns}}[[Louvre]], Paris, France]]

Among the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or &quot;la Gioconda&quot;, the laughing one. In the present era it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality brought about perhaps by the fact that the artist has subtly shadowed the corners of the mouth and eyes so that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined. The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called &quot;[[sfumato]]&quot; or Leonardo's smoke. Vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that &quot;the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Whether or not Vasari had seen the Mona Lisa is the subject of debate. The opinion that he had ''not'' seen the painting is based mainly on the fact that he describes the Mona Lisa as having eyebrows. Daniel Arasse in ''Leonardo da Vinci'' discusses the possibility that Leonardo may have painted the figure with eyebrows which were subsequently removed. (They were not fashionable in the mid-16th century.)&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; The analysis of high resolution scans made by Pascal Cotte has revealed that the Mona Lisa had eyebrows and eyelashes which have been subsequently removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=BBC News |title= The Mona Lisa had brows and lashes | date = 22 October 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7056041.stm | accessdate=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

Other characteristics found in this work are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details, the dramatic landscape background in which the world seems to be in a state of flux, the subdued colouring and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing [[oil paint|oils]], but laid on much like [[tempera]] and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable.{{refn|Jack Wasserman writes of &quot;the inimitable treatment of the surfaces&quot; of this painting.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even &quot;the most confident master{{nbsp}}... despair and lose heart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.266&lt;/ref&gt; The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

In the painting ''[[Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'' the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape which Wasserman describes as &quot;breathtakingly beautiful&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and [[Andrea del Sarto]],&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; and through them [[Pontormo]] and [[Correggio]]. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].

Leonardo's ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|The Battle of Anghiara]]'' was commissioned in 1505, but was lost. All that remains is a copy by [[Rubens]], but [[Maurizio Seracini]] is convinced it can still be found and has spent a lifetime searching for it. He was allowed to drill some pilot holes in a mural in the [[Salone dei Cinquecento]], [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]], and his team did find evidence of an oil painting underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/science/06tier.html |title=A High-Tech Hunt for Lost Art |date=6 October 2009 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecture by Seracini, 2012, https://www.ted.com/talks/maurizio_seracini_the_secret_lives_of_paintings?language=en#t-48953&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drawings ===

Leonardo was not a prolific painter, but he was a most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as ''The Adoration of the Magi'', ''The Virgin of the Rocks'' and ''The Last Supper''.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt;
His earliest dated drawing is a ''Landscape of the Arno Valley'', 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Popham&gt;{{cite book |first=A.E. |last=Popham |title=The Drawings of Leonardo da Vinci |year=1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his famous drawings are the ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', a study of the proportions of the human body, the ''Head of an Angel'', for ''[[The Virgin of the Rocks]]'' in the Louvre, a botanical study of ''Star of Bethlehem'' and a large drawing (160×100&amp;nbsp;cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist]]'' in the National Gallery, London.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; This drawing employs the subtle ''[[sfumato]]'' technique of shading, in the manner of the ''Mona Lisa''. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'' in the Louvre.&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Other drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as &quot;caricatures&quot; because, although exaggerated, they appear to be based upon observation of live models. Vasari relates that if Leonardo saw a person with an interesting face he would follow them around all day observing them.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with Salai, with the rare and much admired facial feature, the so-called &quot;Grecian profile&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The &quot;Grecian profile&quot; has a continuous straight line from forehead to nose-tip, the bridge of the nose being exceptionally high. It is a feature of many [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Classical Greek]] statues.&lt;/ref&gt; These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; Salai is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. Other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. A marked development in Leonardo's ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. Another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli, hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano, brother of Lorenzo de' Medici, in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; With dispassionate integrity Leonardo has registered in neat [[mirror writing]] the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died.

{{See also|List of works by Leonardo da Vinci#Manuscripts}}
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' ({{circa|1485}}) [[Accademia, Venice]]]]

[[Renaissance humanism]] recognized no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and [[natural philosophy]] (the forerunner of modern science), made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

Leonardo's writings are mostly in mirror-image cursive. The reason may have been more a practical expediency than for reasons of secrecy as is often suggested. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it is probable that it was easier for him to write from right to left.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Left-handed writers using a split nib or quill pen experience difficulty pushing the pen from left to right across the page.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - Studies of the foetus in the womb.jpg|thumb|left|A page showing Leonardo's study of a foetus in the womb ({{circa|1510}}) Royal Library, [[Windsor Castle]]]]

His notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water. There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

These notebooks—originally loose papers of different types and sizes, distributed by friends after his death—have found their way into major collections such as the Royal Library at [[Windsor Castle]], [[the Louvre]], the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan which holds the twelve-volume ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'', and [[British Library]] in London which has put a selection from the ''[[Codex Arundel]]'' (BL Arundel MS 263) online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Sketches by Leonardo | work =Turning the Pages | publisher =[[British Library]] | url =http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ttpbooks.html | accessdate =27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Codex Leicester (Leonardo da Vinci)|Codex Leicester]]'' is the only major scientific work of Leonardo's in private hands. It is owned by [[Bill Gates]] and is displayed once a year in different cities around the world.

Leonardo's notes appear to have been intended for publication because many of the sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this. In many cases a single topic, for example, the heart or the human fetus, is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor Castle, Royal Library, sheets RL 19073v–74v and RL 19102, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;This method of organisation minimises of loss of data in the case of pages being mixed up or destroyed.&lt;/ref&gt; Why they were not published within Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

=== Scientific studies ===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|[[Rhombicuboctahedron]] as published in [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli's]]{{brk}}''[[De divina proportione]]'']]

Leonardo's approach to science was an observational one: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasize experiments or theoretical explanation. Since he lacked formal education in [[Latin language|Latin]] and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin. In the 1490s he studied mathematics under [[Luca Pacioli]] and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli's book ''[[De divina proportione]]'', published in 1509.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

It appears that from the content of his journals he was planning a series of treatises to be published on a variety of subjects. A coherent treatise on [[anatomy]] was said to have been observed during a visit by Cardinal Louis 'D' Aragon's secretary in 1517.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Malley |last2=Saunders |title=Leonardo on the Human Body |year=1982 |publisher=Dover Publications |publication-place=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of his work on the studies of anatomy, light and the landscape were assembled for publication by his pupil Francesco Melzi and eventually published as ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Treatise on Painting by Leonardo da Vinci]]'' in France and Italy in 1651 and Germany in 1724,&lt;ref&gt;della Chiesa, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; with engravings based upon drawings by the Classical painter [[Nicolas Poussin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336408/Leonardo-da-Vinci/59102/Sculpture |title=Leonardo da Vinci (Italian artist, engineer, and scientist) : Sculpture – Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arasse, the treatise, which in France went into 62 editions in fifty years, caused Leonardo to be seen as &quot;the precursor of French academic thought on art&quot;.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

While Leonardo's experimentation followed clear scientific methods, a recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by Frtijof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and other scientists who followed him in that, as a Renaissance Man, his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.&lt;ref&gt;Capra, Fritjof. The Science of Leonardo; Inside the Mind of the Genius of the Renaissance. (New York, Doubleday, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anatomy ===
[[File:Studies of the Arm showing the Movements made by the Biceps.jpg|thumb|Anatomical study of the arm, ({{c|1510}})]]

Leonardo started his study in the [[anatomy]] of the [[human body]] under the apprenticeship of [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davinci |first1=Leonardo |title=The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci |publisher=Lulu |isbn=978-1-105-31016-4 |page=736 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGmAAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bibliogroup:%22The+Notebooks+of+Leonardo+Da+Vinci%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFvrLn3v3KAhUEFx4KHRSiCagQ6AEILDAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an artist, he quickly became master of ''topographic anatomy'', drawing many studies of [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s and other visible anatomical features.

As a successful artist, he was given permission to [[Dissection|dissect]] human corpses at the [[Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova]] in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor [[Marcantonio della Torre]]. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words towards a treatise on anatomy.&lt;ref name=Sooke /&gt; These papers were left to his heir, Francesco Melzi, for publication, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing.&lt;ref name=KDK /&gt; It was left incomplete at the time of Melzi's death more than 50 years later, with only a small amount of the material on anatomy included in Leonardo's ''Treatise on painting'', published in France in 1632.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;&lt;ref name=KDK&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keele Kenneth D | year = 1964 | title = Leonardo da Vinci's Influence on Renaissance Anatomy | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1033412/pdf/medhist00157-0072.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Med Hist| volume =  8| issue = | pages =  360–70| pmc=1033412 | pmid=14230140 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300029835}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]] who made a number of drawings from them.&lt;ref name=KDK /&gt;

Leonardo's anatomical drawings include many studies of the [[human skeleton]] and its parts, and studies muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of [[biomechanics]].&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Stephen F. |authorlink=Stephen F. Mason |title=A History of the Sciences |publisher=Collier Books |year=1962 |location=New York, NY |page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew the heart and [[Circulatory system|vascular system]], the [[sex organs]] and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a [[fetus]] ''in utero''.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published, would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.&lt;ref name=Sooke&gt;[[Alastair Sooke]], ''Daily Telegraph'', 28 July 2013, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/leonardo-da-vinci/10202124/Leonardo-da-Vinci-Anatomy-of-an-artist.html &quot;Leonardo da Vinci: Anatomy of an artist&quot;], accessed 29 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an artist, Leonardo also closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He also drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt; Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also made a number of studies of horses.&lt;ref name=Popham /&gt;

=== Investigations ===

Da Vinci performed some very detailed investigations into not only anatomy but also physiology. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. His dissections and documentation of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped to describe the physiology and mechanics of movement.  He found it difficult to incorporate the prevailing system and theories of [[humorism|bodily humours]], but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He also documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define [[atherosclerosis]] and liver [[cirrhosis]]. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass [[aorta]] to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns. Vesalius published his work on anatomy and physiology in ''De humani corporis fabrica'' in 1543.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Roger |title=Leonardo da Vinci: anatomist |journal=British Journal of General Practice |volume=62 |issue=599 |year=2012 |pages=319–319 |issn=0960-1643 |doi=10.3399/bjgp12X649241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering and inventions ===
[[File:Design for a Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|A design for a flying machine, ({{c|1488}}) Institut de France, Paris]]

During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In a letter to [[Ludovico il Moro]], he claimed to be able to create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] also worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Masters |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Masters |title=Machiavelli, Leonardo and the Science of Power |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Masters |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Masters |title=Fortune is a River: Leonardo Da Vinci and Niccolò Machiavelli's Magnificent Dream to Change the Course of Florentine History |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include [[Viola organista|musical instruments]], a [[Leonardo's robot|mechanical knight]], hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a [[steam cannon]].&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

In 1502, Leonardo produced a drawing of a single span {{convert|720|ft|m|adj=on}} bridge as part of a civil engineering project for Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Beyazid II]] of [[Constantinople]]. The bridge was intended to span an inlet at the mouth of the [[Bosporus]] known as the [[Golden Horn]]. Beyazid did not pursue the project because he believed that such a construction was impossible. Leonardo's vision was resurrected in 2001 when a [[Vebjørn Sand Da Vinci Project|smaller bridge]] based on his design was constructed in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/|title=The Leonardo Bridge Project |publisher=Vebjorn-sand.com |date= |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Levy |first=Daniel S. |title=Dream of the Master |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine |date=4 October 1999 |url=http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/dreamsofthemaster.html |accessdate=27 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912033510/http://www.vebjorn-sand.com/dreamsofthemaster.html |archivedate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonardo was fascinated by the phenomenon of [[History of aviation|flight]] for much of his life, producing many studies including ''[[Codex on the Flight of Birds]]'' ({{circa|1505}}), as well as plans for several flying machines such as a flapping [[ornithopter]] and a machine with a helical [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]].&lt;ref name=DA /&gt; The British television station [[Channel Four]] commissioned a 2003 documentary ''Leonardo's Dream Machines''. Leonardo's designs for machines such as a [[Parachute#Early Renaissance|parachute]], and giant crossbow were interpreted, constructed and tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365434/|title=Leonardo's Dream Machines (TV Movie 2003)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/leonardo/parachute.html British Library online gallery] (retrieved 10 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those designs proved successes, whilst others fared less well when practically tested.

== Fame and reputation ==
{{Main article|Cultural references to Leonardo da Vinci}}

Leonardo's fame within his own lifetime was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.&lt;ref name=DA /&gt;

[[Giorgio Vasari]], in the enlarged edition of ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', 1568,&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; introduced his chapter on Leonardo da Vinci with the following words:

{{quote|In the normal course of events many men and women are born with remarkable talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by Heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind, all his actions seem inspired and indeed everything he does clearly comes from God rather than from human skill. Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty, who displayed infinite grace in everything that he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied he solved with ease.|Giorgio Vasari}}

[[File:Francois I recoit les derniers soupirs de Leonard de Vinci by Ingres.jpg||thumb|''Francis I of France receiving the last breath of Leonardo da Vinci'', by [[Ingres]], 1818]]

The continued admiration that Leonardo commanded from painters, critics and historians is reflected in many other written tributes. [[Baldassare Castiglione]], author of ''Il Cortegiano'' (&quot;The Courtier&quot;), wrote in 1528: &quot;...&amp;nbsp;Another of the greatest painters in this world looks down on this art in which he is unequalled&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author-link = Baldassare Castiglione
 | first = Baldassare
 | last = Castiglione

}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the biographer known as &quot;Anonimo Gaddiano&quot; wrote, {{circa|1540}}: &quot;His genius was so rare and universal that it can be said that nature worked a miracle on his behalf{{nbsp}}...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anonimo Gaddiani&quot;, elaborating on ''Libro di Antonio Billi'', 1537–1542&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonardo IMG 1759.JPG|thumb|Statue of Leonardo in [[Amboise]]]]

The 19th century brought a particular admiration for Leonardo's genius, causing [[Henry Fuseli]] to write in 1801: &quot;Such was the dawn of modern art, when Leonardo da Vinci broke forth with a splendour that distanced former excellence: made up of all the elements that constitute the essence of genius{{nbsp}}...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Henry
 | last = Fuseli
 | title = Lectures
 | volume = II
 | year = 1801
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by A. E. Rio who wrote in 1861: &quot;He towered above all other artists through the strength and the nobility of his talents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = A.E.
 | last = Rio
 | title = L'art chrétien
 | year = 1861
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the scope of Leonardo's notebooks was known, as well as his paintings. [[Hippolyte Taine]] wrote in 1866: &quot;There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Hippolyte
 | last = Taine
 | title = Voyage en Italie
 | year = 1866
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Art historian [[Bernard Berenson]] wrote in 1896: &quot;Leonardo is the one artist of whom it may be said with perfect literalness: Nothing that he touched but turned into a thing of eternal beauty. Whether it be the cross section of a skull, the structure of a weed, or a study of muscles, he, with his feeling for line and for light and shade, forever transmuted it into life-communicating values.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Bernard
 | last = Berenson
 | author-link = Bernard Berenson
 | title = The Italian Painters of the Renaissance
 | year = 1896
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in Leonardo's genius has continued unabated; experts study and translate his writings, analyse his paintings using scientific techniques, argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Leonardo can be considered, quite rightly, to have been the universal genius par excellence, and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term. Man is as uncomfortable today, faced with a genius, as he was in the 16th century. Five centuries have passed, yet we still view Leonardo with awe.&quot;&lt;ref name= LB /&gt;

'''Giovanni Mangone''' (born towards the end of 15th century, died 25 June 1543) was an Italian artist active almost exclusively in [[Rome]] during the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Mangone's skills were manifold: he worked as sculptor, architect, [[stonecutter]] and [[building estimator]]. Moreover, he was a keen antiquarian and among the founders of the [[Accademia dei Virtuosi al Pantheon|Academy dei Virtuosi al Pantheon]]. As military engineer, he was renowned among his contemporaries.

==Life and works==
[[File:S M d Anima - controfacciata, Willem van Enckevoirt part P1100341.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt at [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]] in Rome]]
Born around the end of the fifteenth century by Francesco, a native of [[Caravaggio, Lombardy|Caravaggio]] in [[Lombardy]], according to [[Giorgio Vasari]] he studied under sculptor and architect [[Andrea Ferrucci]] from [[Fiesole]].&lt;ref name=ghi&gt;Ghisetti Giavarina (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, where he lived in a palace in via delle Coppelle, between [[Sant'Agostino, Rome|Sant'Agostino]] and [[palazzo Baldassini]], at the beginning of his career had several assignments; from 1527 to 1532 he was superintendent to the spring of S. Peter; until 1541, he was curator of the [[gold-leaf]] ceiling of the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]]; since 1528 and until his death, he was architect of the [[apostolic Chamber]].&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; Moreover, during his whole career he worked also as building estimator.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;

In 1534 started his collaboration with [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]]: together they prepared ''apparati effimeri'' in wood to celebrate the crowning of [[Pope Paul III]] (r. 1534&amp;ndash;49) and in 1536, the visit to Rome of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;

In 1537 Mangone modified the monastery of the [[Servites]] near the [[San Marcello al Corso|Church of San Marcello al Corso]], which he completed.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; However, due to subsequent changes in the seventeenth century, his work at the monastery is no longer recognizable.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;

Perhaps since 1532 he designed for Angelo [[Massimo family|Massimo]] a palace south of [[Piazza Navona]], in [[rioni of Rome|rione]] [[Parione]].&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;&lt;ref name=ri120&gt;Pericoli Ridolfini (1973), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The building, which in 1537 had been completed until its ''piano nobile'', was erroneously named after king [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] because of a statue (actually of Mars) once on display on a yard's niche and now at the [[Musei Capitolini]].&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; The edifice is adjacent to the palace named [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]], realized in those years by [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] and commissioned by Angelo's brother Pietro.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;&lt;ref name=ri120/&gt;

Palazzo Massimo di Pirro is Mangone's only certain architectural work still extant.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; In this building his model is Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, of whom he adopts typological schemes and &amp;ndash; partially &amp;ndash; stylistic features.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; Anyway, in several elements, like the design of the irregular yard, the adoption of [[loggia]]s with [[architrave]], the usage of decorative elements as [[corbels]], the equilibrium of the façade, he shows an original style.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;&lt;ref name=gi144&gt;Gigli (1992) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ri120/&gt;

Based on stylistic analysis, have been attributed to him also the [[palazzo Alicorni]] in Borgo Vecchio (later piazza Rusticucci) in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] (demolished in 1931 and later rebuilt) and &amp;ndash; more doubtfully &amp;ndash; the Palazzetto De Vellis in Piazza [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]].&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; 

As a sculptor, only two works have been attributed to him: well-done appears to be the funerary monument to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Willem van Enckevoirt]] (dead in 1534) in [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]], where is evident an influence from [[Michelangelo]], while that of the [[bishop]] of [[Chiusi]] and Governor of [[Bologna]] Gregorio Magalotti in [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], engraved in 1538, radiates a cold feeling.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;

As a [[military architecture|military architect]], in 1542 Mangone was summoned together with other architects by  Paul III, who wanted to enhance the fortifications of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], and in that occasion he presented a project.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;The following year he was active in [[Sermoneta]], working at the town's walls.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; Mangone was also a keen [[antiquarian]], and collected in his palace a good deal of architectural and sculptural pieces.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; In 1543, defining himself as a sculptor, he was among the founding members of the Congregation of &quot;St. Joseph in the Holy Land at the Rotonda&quot;, later known as the [[Accademia dei Virtuosi al Pantheon]], one of the main centers of discussions about antiquities and architecture in Rome.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;

On 25 June 1543 he made his will, dying perhaps on the same day.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;

==Significance==
[[File:PalazzoAlicorniInRomeBefore1928.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Alicorni]] (here before its demolition in 1931 and later reconstruction) could be attributed to Mangone because of its stylistic resemblance with the Palazzo di Pirro]]
As a sculptor, Mangone followed [[Andrea Sansovino]], reaching mixed results. &lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; 
As an architect, his former education as a sculptor and [[stonemason]] in the design of [[molding (decorative)|molding]]s allowed him to reach a remarkable equilibrium of proportions.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; Moreover, Mangone was among the first to spread the &quot;severe&quot; style initiated by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; With the Palazzo di Pirro, he designed a good example of &quot;everyday&quot; architecture which found many imitators in the second part of 16th century.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt; 
As a military architect, although he was praised by the [[military engineer]] Francesco De Marchi, the absence of extant works which can be attributed to him makes difficult to assess its real contribution to this field.&lt;ref name=ghi/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1155">'''Pere Blai''' (1553–1621) was a Spanish architect.

He probably studied under his father, master of the fountains in [[Barcelona]], and his brother. He was in relationship with  [[Jaume Amigó]], influenced Blai's knowledge of [[Renaissance architecture]] and led to his appointment as building master of the  [[diocese of Tarragona]].

His works include the Chapel of the Holiest in the [[Cathedral of Tarragona]] (1582), in which he succeeded Bernat Cassany; the parish church in [[La Selva del Camp]] (1582); the chapels of St. John and St. Fructuous in the Cathedral of Tarragona (1592); parish church of [[Cornudella de Montsant]] (1599); and the parish church of the Apostle James at [[Riudoms]] (1617).

In 1565 Lluís d'Icard commissioned him the construction of the Palace-Castle of [[Torredembarra]], and example of Catalan Renaissance architecture. He also designed the southern façade of the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] in  Barcelona.

Considered one of the great pioneers of architecture during the [[Renaissance]], Michelozzo was a favored [[House of Medici|Medici]] architect who was extensively employed by [[Cosimo de' Medici]]. He was a pupil of [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] in his early years and later collaborated with [[Donatello]].

Known primarily by non-historians for designing [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in [[Florence]], he is often overshadowed by his contemporaries [[Donatello]] in sculpture and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] in architecture. &quot;He remained for his biographers a shadowy, active, competent, second-rate figure, circling around the glowing glory of the two dominant masters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Life==

=== Early life   ===
Michelozzo was born in [[Florence]] in 1396. He was the son of Bartolomeo di Gherardo Borgognone and Antonia. Borgognone was of French origin and arrived in Florence from [[Burgundy]] at an unknown date.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Michelozzo|last=Caplow|first=Harriet McNeal|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc.|year=1977|isbn=0-8240-2678-0|location=New York|pages=537–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borgognone lived and worked in the Santo Croce quarter of Florence as a tailor, and was made a Florentine citizen on April 9, 1376.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Michelozzo di Bartolommeo|last=Fabriczy|first=Cornelius von|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=59ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelozzo had three brothers named Leonardo (b. 1389/90), Zanobi (b. 1391), and Giovanni (b. 1403). By 1391, Michelozzo's family had moved to the San Giovanni quarter, where they continued to live throughout his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Little is known about Michelozzo's childhood, other than that he received a comprehensive education in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and that he began working as a die-engraver for the [[Mint (facility)|Florentine mint]] in 1410. As an engraver, Michelozzo learned how to cast, chase, and gild copper and bronze, two of the metals in which the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] goldsmith most commonly worked. He also gained immense precision of hand and a mastery of sculptural design in miniature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Donatello &amp; Michelozzo: An Artistic Partnership and its Patrons in the Early Renaissance|last=Lightbrown|first=R.W.|publisher=Harvey Miller|year=1980|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 1420s, Michelozzo became a member of the [[Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e Legname|Arte di Maestri di Pietra e Legname]], one of the Guilds of Florence that represented the master stonemasons, wood-carvers, and sculptors. He later served as one of the consuls of the Guild in 1430.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Throughout his life, Michelozzo retained the family residence on [[Via Camillo Cavour|Via Larga]], which was near the Medici Palace and next door to the humanist Bartolomeo Scala. In addition, Michelozzo possessed a house and garden in S. Domino a Brozzi.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Michelozzo's father died sometime before 1427, and his mother passed sometime between 1433 and 1442.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Apprenticeships ===
Beginning in 1420, Michelozzo studied under [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]. Michelozzo's first projects with Ghiberti was the North Door of the Baptistry between the years 1417 and 1423/4, in which Michelozzo's responsibilities &quot;could only have been in the chasing and gilding of the panels, possibly in casting the four late reliefs...and in the frame....Most of his work on the doors is submerged, like that of the other assistants, in the force of Ghiberti's design and personality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; From this, Michelozzo learned how to run a closely supervised shop, how to organize it efficiently, how to train and control assistants, and how to deal shrewdly in business and financial affairs. &quot;He was exposed to Ghiberti's use of antique motifs, he absorbed Ghiberti's ability in juxtaposing antique and Gothic elements, and he was undoubtedly influenced by Ghiberti's style and artistic concepts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; While working under Ghiberti, Michelozzo created the statue of the young St. John over the door of the [[Santa Maria del Fiore|Duomo]] in Florence, opposite the [[Baptistery (Florence)|Baptistery]], along with the silver statuette of [[John the Baptist]] on the altar-frontal of San Giovanni.

Under [[Donatello]], Michelozzo assisted in the building of the sacristy of [[Santa Trinita]], where &quot;Ghiberti [had] started to fuse together late-Gothic and antique forms.&quot; Both Donatello and Michelozzo began as sculptors with an uncompromising dedication to antiquity, and this was evident when Donatello enlisted Michelozzo's help in the decoration of the tabernacle of [https://santacroceinflorence.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/donatellos-saint-louis-of-toulouse-restored/ St. Louis of Toulouse]. Michelozzo also became the partner responsible for the architectural frames of Donatello's sculptures such as the funerary monument of [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]. In 1428, together with Donatello, Michelozzo erected an open-air pulpit at an angle of the [[cathedral of St. Stephen, Prato|Cathedral of St. Stephen]] at [[Prato]], designed for the regular public displays of their famous [[relic]], the [[Girdle of Thomas]] (''Sacra Cintola''). Though Donatello is the more well-known of the two, &quot;it would be a mistake to underrate Michelozzo's share in the work, for where Donatello appears as the sole designer of architectural ornament his style is quite different. He completely subordinates the architectural setting to his sculpture and makes architecture, so to speak, its handmaid. The beautiful ornamental sculpture in Brunelleschi's [[Sagrestia Vecchia]] shows how far Donatello would go with his sculpture in order to provide it with an effective frame in the extraordinarily vigorous modelling of the broad, slanting surrounds of his overdoors and medallions.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

== Influences and Patronage  ==

=== Cosimo dei Medici ===
[[image:Palazzo Medici Riccardi.JPG|thumb|250px|The facade of [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Palazzo Medici]] in Florence.]]Few historians have disputed Cosimo's close relationship to Michelozzo, who was the Medici architect for nearly forty years. &quot;Michelozzo was more agreeable and accessible to the advice and desires of Cosimo than the turbulent Brunelleschi, and was willing to follow the strong personal tastes of his patron.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Their relationship was best described by Angelo Fabroni in 1789, who said: &quot;Cosimo loved Michelozzo dearly and relied on him, not only because of his natural talents (he considered nobody, not even Brunelleschi, superior in all architectural judgments), but also because of his good qualities and worth character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Magni Cosmi Medicei Vita|last=Fabroni|first=Angelo|publisher=|year=1789|isbn=|location=|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelozzo enjoyed a close relationship to [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo dei Medici]] throughout his life, and according to [[Giorgio Vasari]] in ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, from Cimabue to Our Times]]'', was motivated by his great love and fidelity for Cosimo to accompany him into exile in Venice from 1433 to 1434. Historians have cited this as an unparalleled example of esteem between artist and patron. Vasari also claimed that Michelozzo built the library of [[San Giorgio|S. Giorgio]] in 1434 for Cosimo, though this claim contradicts the original description and documents of the library, which indicate that although the library's construction was started by Cosimo, it was largely built under the direction of Medici bank manager Giovanni d'Orino Lanfredini between 1467 and 1478, which was well after Michelozzo's departure for Venice.

The large [[Palazzo Medici]] in Florence, built by Cosimo, was designed by him; it is one of the noblest specimens of Italian fifteenth-century architecture, in which the great taste and skill of the architect has combined the delicate lightness of the earlier Italian [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] with the massive stateliness of the classical style. With great engineering skill Michelozzo shored up, and partly rebuilt, the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], then in a ruinous condition, and added to it many important rooms and staircases. When, in 1437, through Cosimo's liberality, the monastery of San Marco at Florence was handed over to the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] of [[Fiesole]], Michelozzo was employed to rebuild the domestic part and remodel the church. For Cosimo he designed numerous other buildings, most of them of noteworthy importance. Among these were a guest-house at [[Jerusalem]] for the use of Florentine pilgrims, Cosimo's summer [[Villa Medici at Careggi|villa at Careggi]], and the fortified ''castello'' that he rebuilt from 1452 as the [[Villa Medicea di Cafaggiolo]] in [[Mugello region|Mugello]]. For [[Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], Cosimo's son, he also built a very large [[Villa Medici in Fiesole|villa at Fiesole]].

=== Filippo Brunelleschi ===
According to &quot;Architecture in Italy, 1400-1500, Volume 53&quot;, Michelozzo's architecture contrasts with Brunelleschi in its closer adherence to the &quot;immediately preceding Gothic tradition, the Gothic classicism which appears in the Loggia dei Lanzi or the monastery of S. Matteo.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architecture in Italy, 1400-1500, Volume 53|last=Heydenreich|first=Ludwig Heinrich|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Heydenreich and Paul Davies argue that all of Michelozzo's buildings are &quot;works of considerable standing...the most independent architect after Brunelleschi.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Michelozzo married Francesca, daughter of Piero di Ambrogio Galligari, in late January or February of 1441. At the time of their marriage, she was 20 years old, and he was 45.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Francesca's dowry of 425 florins was about average for an upper-middle-class family at that time. The size of her dowry indicates a considerable rise in Michelozzo's social position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=&quot;The Social World of the Florentine Humanists, 1390-1460&quot;|last=Martines|first=Lauro|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|year=2011|isbn=978-1442611825|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1441, Michelozzo launched a legal complaint to remove himself from the responsibility of his two older brothers' debts. Andrea di Benozo, representative for Giovanni, Zanobi, and Michelozzo, elected arbitrators to weigh the complaints. After studying documents and proofs for six weeks, the arbitrators found that the two brothers were the cause behind most of Michelozzo's debts, and they were required to relinquish their inheritance in partial compensation for the amounts they owed.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Children ===
Four boys and three girls resulted from Michelozzo's marriage to Francesca, of whom five survived their father. Bartolomeo, who became a sculptor, was born in 1442; Piero in 1443; Antonia in 1445; Niccolo in 1447; Marietta in 1453; Bernardo in 1455; and Lisabetta in 1459.

Two of his sons, Niccolò and Bernardo, were partially educated by the Medici and may have lived in the Palazzo Medici during their youth. They later achieved success in the highest humanistic circles of Florence.

Bernardo became a member of the household of [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo il Magnifico]] as the tutor of [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de Medici]]. In 1500, he was made a Florentine canon and was employed by [[Pope Leo X|Giovanni de Medici]], first as his Chamberlain and then as his Secretary and Referendary.

Like Bernardo, Niccolò studied with [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino]] from a young age and took part in the [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]], where he formed friendships with other Florentine humanists who shared his love for antiquity. He excelled in literature and philosophy, and he later became secretary to [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero di Cosimo]] and continued in the post under [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici|Piero di Lorenzo]]. In 1469, Niccolò began his political career as a notary in the Florentine Cancelleria, and he was often sent on important missions as ambassador for the Florentine Republic between 1489 and 1494. Following the downfall of the Medici, he was imprisoned for a brief time before clearing his name in 1496 and becoming the precounsel of the [[:it:Arte dei Giudici e Notai|Arte dei Giucidi e notai]] and later succeeded [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Niccolò Machiavalli]] as the Second Chancellor of the Republic in 1513.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Works ==

=== Palazzo Medici ===
[[File:Palazzo Medici courtyard Apr 2008 (10).JPG|thumb|The courtyard of [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]].]]When Cosimo began building the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Palazzo Medici]] in 1444, he passed over [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and gave his preference to Michelozzo. Like the exterior of the [[Palazzo Comunale, San Gimignano|Palazzo Comunale]] in [[Montefiascone]], that of the Palazzo Medici follows the tradition of the Tuscan late-medieval palazzo, but without the more eye-catching symbols of civic power, which would have been incompatible with Cosimo's role as ''primus inter pares'' and ''pater patriae''. The palazzo's exterior is not articulated by Vitruvian orders, and its big arches of its ground floor are not aligned with the windows of the upper stories. Instead, Michelozzo focused on the contrast between surface textures, such as the contrast between &quot;the natural rustication of the ground floor, the flat ashlared courses of the ''piano nobile'' and the smooth masonry of the upper storey.&quot; The exterior also differs from the palazzo in [[Montepulciano]] in its size, its more urbane character, and its massive classicizing cornice. &quot;In its succession of dentils, egg-and-dart and consoles, Michelozzo directly followed the [[Temple of Serapis]] in Rome.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance|last=Frommel|first=Christoph Luitpold|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, London|year=2007|isbn=|location=New York|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunelleschi's influence on Michelozzo is evident in the palazzo's design, especially in the late-medieval ''bifora''-windows, the symmetry and the dominance of the entrance axis, and the combination of traditional and progressive elements. The arcades and entablature of the palazzo's courtyard also follows the model of the loggia of the Spedale degli Innocenti, which is symptomatically Brunelleschi's earliest and most un-Vitruvian building.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

One of Michelozzo's most well-known architectural projects, the palace led to the development of a new architectural type: the Florentine Renaissance palace. Among the many Michelozzo innovations on the facade, the most notable include: &quot;the use of bugnato digradante (large unevenly-cut stones which grow lighter as they ascend on the upper stories), the classical columns and fluted capitals in the bifore windows, the great classical cornice crowning the building and the small ones dividing the stories, the massive rectangular proportions of the block of square, and the regularity of the disposition of the windows, which, however, are assymetrical in regard to the doors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== San Marco ===
[[File:Museo nazionale di San Marco Florenz-7.jpg|thumb|[[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]] in [[Florence]]]]
The fundamental basis of all monastic compounds built by architects during the Renaissance, this was one of Michelozzo's first and most influential architectural projects in Florence. Constructed at the expense of Cosimo dei Medici, the project began sometime between the years 1437 and 1438. Reconstruction included the church, sacristy, cloister, monastic living quarters, and the library. [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]] has been called the first Renaissance church, though it seems to be a compromise between the Trecento tradition and the Renaissance spirit. The plain white walls without frescos differ from the coloristic tradition of the Trecento and were essential to Michelozzo's architectural concepts and preference for large, unadorned surfaces, subtly articulated by necessary structural members in grey pietra serena.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Like many of his projects, San Marco was constructed with incredible rapidity. Unlike Brunelleschi, Michelozzo was able to finish what he started, largely due to Michelozzo's efficiency and due to the availability of adequate financing from Cosimo throughout the campaign.

The first part undertaken by Michelozzo was &quot;the rebuilding of the old refectory, where a low vault, supported by consoles much like those in the sacristy at S. Trinita, was built to sustsain the cells above. Work began on the church in 1438 and was probably completed three years later, though certainly by 1443 when it was consecrated by [[Pope Eugene IV|Pope Eugene]]. Using the perimeter of the former Trecento church, Michelozzo added a polygonal apse, similar in form to that at Bosco ai Frati; it was lighted by three long round arch pietra serena windows which can still be seen in the upper story of the convent. The pointed entrance arch rested on two pilasters with large, classical Corinthian capitals surmounted by a dado decorated with the Medici balls (also still visible). In front of the apse was the Capella Maggiore, covered with groin vaulting. The nave was a single open space without aisles, adorned with ediculas or altars (three on each side), and covred with a wooden beamed ceiling. Separating the nave and the Cappella Maggiore was a high wall (tramezzo) with two doors. In the later remodelling of the church, the wall was removed and the doors were transferred to the polygonal apse where they are now located. Their fluted pilasters are crowned with composite capitals identical to those in the Barbadori Chapel in S. Felicita by Brunelleschi, and above the architrave with classical mouldings, the frieze is decorated, like the capitals at Bosco ai Frati, with the Medici balls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Choir of the Santissima Annunziata ===
Commissioned by [[Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua|Lodovico Gonzaga]], lord of Mantua and general of the Florentine troops, the choir was created in commemoration of Gonzaga's father and &quot;for the celebration of masses for his soul.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Cosimo had already commissioned Michelozzo with the construction of the church's vestibulum and atrium in order to continue Brunelleschi's idea of a forum ''all'antica.'' In designing the Santissima Annunziata, Michelozzo followed the model of the [[Minerva Medica]] in [[Rome]], making the inner plan round, creating a dome that was as hemispheric the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], and detailing it with a ten-sided exterior with deep, over-semicircular chapels. He also opted for a drum and a dome without ribs. Though the Santissima Annunziata was Michelozzo's attempt to surpass Brunelleschi on his ground, &quot;a comparison of the two ground plans suffices to show how utterly superior Brunelleschi's is.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Santa Croce ===
In the May 1966 issue of ''The Burlington Magazine,'' Howard Saalman wrote that &quot;the language of the details of the Ex-Dormitory and the Ex-Library wing points to Michelozzo. If Vasari is right and Michelozzo ''did'' work at Santa Croce (and there is no reason to doubt it in spite of the lack of documentation) then Michelozzo and his circle probably handled the entire operation as at San Marco, SS. Annunziata and elsewhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saalman|first=Howard|date=1966|title=Michelozzo Studies|url=|journal=The Burlington Magazine|issue=Vol. 108, No. 758|pages=242–250|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelozzo added various parts to the church and cloister of Santa Croce, including &quot;the loggia in front of the Ex-Dormitory and Library (octagonal columns with ''foglie d'acqua'' capitals) which originally extended across the cloister to the elevated loggia on the south side of the church, running along the eastern flank of the San Giuliano (Mellini) Chapel...which divided the first cloister into two parts before its destruction in the nineteenth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Additionally, the Cerchi Chapel on &quot;the ground floor of the Ex-Library wing at the end adjacent to the Ex-Refectory is evidently inserted into older peripheral walls which survived the 1423 fire. The language of the details (pilasters flanking the opening into the little square choir, capitals of the lunette vaults of the hall in front of the choir - which overlap older windows in the side walls) is that of the Michelozzo circle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

=== Other Notable Works ===
From 1461 through 1464, he constructed the walls of [[Ston]] in [[Dalmatia]], the largest medieval wall in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.croazia-turismo.it/dalmazia/stagno/cosa_visitare.html What to visit in Stagno. Croatian tourist website] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and Legacy ==
[[File:Chiostro di San Marco in Florence.JPG|thumb|Cloister of [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]] in [[Florence]]]]
In spite of [[Vasari]]'s statement that he died at the age of sixty-eight, he appears to have lived until 1472. He is buried in the monastery of [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]], Florence.

One of the most influential, yet unknown, architects of the [[Early Renaissance]], Michelozzo's designs paved the way for the rapid development of the Central Italian Palazzo type. He developed the aisleless church and became the pioneer of a plan-type of sacred building, which is the most important in modern times. He transformed secular building and his adaptability in use of traditional forms enabled him to evolve good compromise solutions for distant regions, such as [[Lombardy]] and [[Dalmatia|Damatia]].

In his careful treatment of architectural ornament, &quot;Michelozzo was able to adopt ideas and turn them to good account as well as to transmit new ones. The styles of Manetti, Bernardo Rossellino, Giuliano da Maiano, and even of Giuliano da Sangallo are unimaginable without the support and influence of Michelozzo's artistic idiom in addition to that of Brunelleschi, and later, of Donatello.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

'''Filippo Brunelleschi''' ({{IPA-it|fiˈlippo brunelˈleski|lang}}; 1377 – April 15, 1446) was an Italian designer and a key figure in architecture, recognised to be the first modern engineer, planner and sole construction supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Diane|last=Bodart|title=Renaissance &amp; Mannerism|location=New York |publisher=Sterling|year=2008 |isbn=978-1402759222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was the oldest amongst the founding fathers of the [[Renaissance]]. He is generally well known for developing a technique for [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]] in art and for building the dome of the [[Florence Cathedral]]. Heavily depending on mirrors and geometry, to &quot;reinforce Christian spiritual 'reality'&quot;, his formulation of linear perspective governed pictorial depiction of space until the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filippo Brunelleschi|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Filippo_Brunelleschi.aspx|publisher=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scielo.br&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edgerton|first1=Samuel|title=Brunelleschi's mirror, Alberti's window, and Galileo's 'perspective tube'|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-59702006000500010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also had the most profound – and quite unanticipated – influence on the rise of modern science.&lt;ref name=&quot;scielo.br&quot;/&gt; His accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and ship design. His principal surviving works are to be found in [[Florence]], Italy. Unfortunately, his two original linear perspective panels have been lost.

Brunelleschi was born in Florence, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biography.com/people/filippo-brunelleschi-9229632&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about his early life, the only sources being [[Antonio Manetti]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;For an English version of Vasari's description of the life and work of Brunelleschi, see: http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/vasari/vasari5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to these sources, Filippo's father was Brunellesco di Lippo, a notary, and his mother was Giuliana Spini. Filippo was the middle of their three children. The young Filippo was given a literary and mathematical education intended to enable him to follow in the footsteps of his father, a civil servant. Being artistically inclined, however, Filippo enrolled in the ''[[Guilds of Florence|Arte della Seta]]'', the silk merchants' Guild, which also included goldsmiths, metalworkers, and bronze workers. He became a master goldsmith in 1398. It was thus not a coincidence that his first important building commission, the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti]], came from the guild to which he belonged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battisti 1981&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=Eugenio |last=Battisti |title=Filippo Brunelleschi |location=New York |publisher=Rizzoli |year=1981 |isbn=0-8478-5015-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1401, Brunelleschi entered a competition to design a new set of [[bronze]] doors for the [[Florence Baptistery]]. Seven competitors each produced a gilded bronze panel, depicting the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]]. Brunelleschi's entry, which, with that of [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], is one of only two to have survived, made reference to the Greco-Roman ''[[Boy with Thorn]]''. Brunelleschi's panel consists of several pieces bolted to the back plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Paul Robert |last=Walker |title=The Feud that Sparked the Renaissance: How Brunelleschi and Ghiberti Changed the Art World |location=New York |publisher=William Morrow |year=2002 |isbn=0-380-97787-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an architect==
[[File:Brunelleshi-and-Duomo-of-Florence.png|thumb|Section of the dome]]

Brunelleschi is considered a seminal figure of the [[Renaissance]]. Little biographical information about Brunelleschi's life exists to explain his transition from [[goldsmith]] to architect, nor of his training in the gothic or medieval manner or transition to the new classicism in architecture and urbanism. By 1400 there emerged an interest in ''humanitas'', which contrasted with the formalism of the medieval period, but initially this new interest in Roman antiquity was restricted to a few scholars, writers and philosophers; it did not at first influence the visual arts. Apparently it was in this period (1402–1404) that Brunelleschi and his friend [[Donatello]] visited Rome to study the ancient Roman ruins. Donatello, like Brunelleschi, had received his training in a goldsmith's workshop, and had then worked in Ghiberti's studio. Although in previous decades the writers and philosophers had discussed the glories of [[Ancient Rome]], it seems that until Brunelleschi and Donatello made their journey, no one had studied the physical fabric of these ruins in any great detail. They also gained inspiration from ancient Roman authors, especially [[Vitruvius]], whose ''[[De Architectura]]'' provided an intellectual framework for the standing structures still visible.

===Commissions===
Brunelleschi's first architectural commission was the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] (1419–ca.1445), or Foundling Hospital. Its long [[loggia]] would have been a rare sight in the tight and curving streets of [[Florence]], not to mention its impressive arches, each about 8 meters high. The building was dignified and sober; there were no displays of fine [[marble]] or decorative inlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Klotz |first=Heinrich |title=Filippo Brunelleschi: the Early Works and the Medieval Tradition |others=Translated by Hugh Keith |location=London |publisher=Academy Editions |year=1990 |isbn=0-85670-986-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first building in Florence to make clear reference—in its columns and capitals—to [[classical antiquity]].

Soon other commissions came, such as the [[Ridolfi Chapel]] in the church of [[San Jacopo sopr'Arno]], now lost, and the [[Barbadori Chapel]] in [[Santa Trinita]], also modified since its building. For both, Brunelleschi devised elements already used in the Ospedale degli Innocenti, and which would also be used in the [[Pazzi Chapel]] and the [[Sagrestia Vecchia]]. At the same time he was using such smaller works as a sort of feasibility study for his most famous work, the dome of the [[Cathedral of Florence]].

===Florence Cathedral===
[[File:Bunelleschi.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of Brunelleschi looking at his cathedral dome]]

[[Santa Maria del Fiore]] was the new cathedral of the city, and by 1418 the [[dome]] had yet to be defined. When the building was designed in the previous century, no one had any idea how such a dome was to be built, given that it was to be even larger than the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]'s dome in Rome and that no dome of that size had been built since antiquity. Because [[buttresses]] were forbidden by the city fathers, and because it was impossible to obtain rafters for [[scaffolding]] long and strong enough (and in sufficient quantity) for the task, it was unclear how a dome of that size could be constructed without it collapsing under its own weight. Also, the stresses of [[hoop stress|compression]] were not clearly understood, and the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortars]] used in the period would set only after several days, keeping the strain on the scaffolding for a very long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ross |last=King |title=Brunelleschi's Dome: The Story of the great Cathedral of Florence |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |year=2001 |isbn=0-8027-1366-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1418, the Arte della Lana, the wool merchants' guild, held a competition to solve the problem. The two main competitors were [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]] and Brunelleschi, with Brunelleschi winning and receiving the commission. The competition consisted of the great architects attempting to stand an egg upright on a piece of marble. None could do it but Brunelleschi, who, according to [[Vasari]]:&lt;ref&gt;From Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, published 1500. Quoted from 'Italian Renaissance', Martin Roberts for Longman, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;... giving one end a blow on the flat piece of marble, made it stand upright ...The architects protested that they could have done the same; but Filippo answered, laughing, that they could have made the dome, if they had seen his design.&quot; (This solution was also attributed to Columbus; see [[Egg of Columbus]].)

The dome, the lantern (built 1446–ca.1461) and the [[exedra]] (built 1439–1445) would occupy most of Brunelleschi's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Howard |last=Saalman |title=Filippo Brunelleschi: The Cupola of Santa Maria del Fiore |location=London |publisher=A. Zwemmer |year=1980 |isbn=0-302-02784-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's success can be attributed, in no small degree, to his technical and mathematical genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Frank |last=Prager |title=Brunelleschi: Studies of his Technology and Inventions |location=Cambridge |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-262-16031-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nfnDAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi used more than four million bricks in the construction of the dome. He invented a new hoisting machine for raising the masonry needed for the dome, a task no doubt inspired by republication of [[Vitruvius]]' ''De Architectura'', which describes Roman machines used in the 1st century AD to build large structures such as the Pantheon and the [[Baths of Diocletian]], structures still standing which he would have seen for himself. He also issued one of the first [[patents]] for the [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] in an attempt to prevent the theft of his ideas. Brunelleschi was granted the first modern patent for his invention of a river transport vessel.&lt;ref&gt;The origins of the industrial property right. See: http://www.european-patent-office.org/wbt/pi-tour/tour.php Step 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunelleschi kept his workers up in the building during their breaks and brought food and diluted wine, similar to that given to pregnant women at the time, up to them. He felt the trip up and down the hundreds of stairs would exhaust them and reduce their productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance |url=http://www.pbs.org/empires/medici/ |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |network=PBS |airdate=February 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==

[[File:Pazzi Chapel Santa Croce Apr 2008 P.JPG|thumb|Chapel of the Pazzi family, one of his last works]]

Brunelleschi's interests extended to mathematics and engineering and the study of ancient monuments. He invented [[hydraulic machinery]] and elaborate clockwork, none of which survives.

Brunelleschi also designed fortifications used by Florence in its military struggles against [[republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[republic of Siena|Siena]]. In 1424, he was working in [[Lastra a Signa]], a village protecting the route to Pisa, and in 1431 in the south of Italy on the walls of the village of [[Staggia]]. These walls are still preserved, but whether they are specifically by Brunelleschi is uncertain.

He also was active briefly in the world of shipmaking, when, in 1427, he built an enormous ship named ''Il Badalone'' to transport marble to Florence from Pisa up the [[Arno River]]. The ship sank on its maiden voyage, along with a sizable chunk of Brunelleschi's personal fortune.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/widgets/notes_quotes/more/2002/brunelleschis_monster_patent_il_badalone Brunelleschi's Monster Patent: Il Badalone]&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides his accomplishments in architecture, Brunelleschi is also credited with inventing one-point linear [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] which revolutionized painting and paved the way for naturalistic styles to develop as the [[Renaissance]] digressed from the stylized figures of medieval art. In addition, he was somewhat involved in urban planning: he strategically positioned several of his buildings in relation to the nearby squares and streets for &quot;maximum visibility&quot;. For example, demolitions in front of San Lorenzo were approved in 1433 in order to create a piazza facing the church. At Santo Spirito, he suggested that the façade be turned either towards the Arno so travelers would see it, or to the north, to face a large, prospective piazza.

===Discovery of linear perspective===
[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|left|diagram of Brunelleschi's experiment]]
Brunelleschi is famous for two panel paintings illustrating geometric optical [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]] made in the early 15th century. His biographer, [[Antonio Manetti]], described this famous experiment in which Brunelleschi painted two panels: the first being the [[Florence Baptistery|Florentine Baptistery]] as viewed frontally from the western portal of the unfinished cathedral, the other one is the Palazzo Vecchio seen obliquely from its northwest corner. These were not, however, the first paintings with accurate linear perspective, which may be attributed to [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] ([[Annunciation (Ambrogio_Lorenzetti)|Annunciation]], 1344).

The first Baptistery panel was constructed with a hole drilled through the centric vanishing point. Curiously, Brunelleschi intended that it only be observed by the viewer facing the Baptistery, looking through the hole in the panel, from the unpainted backside. As a mirror was moved into and out of view, the observer saw the striking similarity between the actual view of the Baptistery, and the reflected view of the painted Baptistery image. Brunelleschi wanted his new perspective &quot;realism&quot; to be tested not by comparing the painted image to the actual Baptistery but to its reflection in a mirror according to the Euclidean laws of geometric optics.  This feat showed artists vividly how they might paint their images, not merely as flat two-dimensional shapes, but looking more like three-dimensional structures, just as mirrors reflect them. Unfortunately, both panels have since been lost.&lt;ref&gt;For proposed reconstructions of Brunelleschi's demonstration, see {{Cite book |first=Samuel Y. |last=Edgerton |title=The Mirror, the Window &amp; the Telescope: How Renaissance Linear Perspective Changed Our Vision of the Universe |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8014-4758-7 }} And István Orosz, http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/artist.php?image=1612&amp;id=utisz&amp;page=214&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time linear perspective, as a novel artistic tool, spread not only in Italy but throughout Western Europe. It quickly became, and remains, standard studio practice.

===Theatrical machinery===
Brunelleschi also designed machinery for use in churches during theatrical religious performances that re-enacted Biblical miracle stories. Contrivances were created by which characters and angels were made to fly through the air in the midst of spectacular explosions of light and fireworks. These events took place during state and ecclesiastical visits. It is not known for certain how many of these Brunelleschi designed, but at least one, for the church of [[San Felice, Florence|San Felice]], is confirmed in the records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battisti 1981&quot; /&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Duomo Firenze Apr 2008 (13).JPG|thumb|Brunelleschi's tomb]]

Brunelleschi's body lies in the crypt of the Cathedral of Florence. As explained by [[Antonio Manetti]], who knew Brunelleschi and who wrote his biography, Brunelleschi &quot;was granted such honors as to be buried in the [[Florence Cathedral|Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore]], and with a marble bust, which was said to be carved from life, and placed there in perpetual memory with such a splendid [[epitaph]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Antonio |last=Manetti |title=The Life of Brunelleschi |others=English translation of the Italian text by Catherine Enggass |location=University Park |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-271-00075-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the cathedral entrance is this epitaph: &quot;Both the magnificent dome of this famous church and many other devices invented by Filippo the architect, bear witness to his superb skill. Therefore, in tribute to his exceptional talents, a grateful country that will always remember him buries him here in the soil below.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3500">'''Nickel Hoffmann''' (also known as '''Nikolaus Hofmann''', 1536 - 1592) was a German stonemason, sculptor, craftsman, and builder of the Great Masters in the later part of the [[Gothic Art]] movement and the [[Renaissance]] in central Germany.

==Life and Work==
Nickel Hoffmann was at [[Mansfeld]] involved in mining and was, at a young age, already reached relative prosperity. The Saxon towns of [[Torgau]], [[Pirna]] and [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] were his favorite towns. In Pirna and Halle, he was also recognized as a citizen. He is especially known for his church and town hall buildings.

===Work in Torgau===
In 1536, he produced sculptural ornamental work for Wing C of [[Hartenfels Castle]] for Torgau. In 1543 and 1544 he worked again on Hartenfels Castle, but this time on wing B.

===Work in Pirna===
Hoffmann had his masterpiece in Pirna in, at the latest, 1539 - 1540. In 1540, he became a citizen in Pirna, where he also received orders from the Council. In 1555, during the period in which he mainly worked in Halle, he was a co-signatory of the order of masons of Pirna.

===Work in Halle===
From 1542 to 1543, he worked at the [[Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen]] in Halle. Whether Hoffmann already had operational planning for the work in Torgau has not been established. It is thought that he, with Jakob Hans from the now Czech city of [[Chomutov]] as polishing, took over construction management in 1545. In addition, he ran well on his own, with a sculpture in the woman cemetery and delivered a considerable amount of goods for the construction of the church. The church was completed under his direction until 1554th It was equipped with a vault, a gallery was built and the towers were increased. Hoffmann is often known as a foreman for this building.

During the construction period in 1550, Hoffman became a citizen of Halle. As in Pirna, he also took orders the Council of the city. Among other things, in 1557, he built the system of [[Stadtgottesacker]] and in 1580 the [[Wagegebäude am Markt]]. Between 1554 and 1557, he completed the curvature of the [[Moritzkirche]].In 1568, he was responsible for expanding the town hall tower.

===Other works===
Hoffmann built the Südpartie City Hall in [[Merseburg]] in 1561 and, 1563 from 1566, the town hall in [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] in [[Upper Franconia]]. In 1568, he briefly was the oldest foreman at the palace of Augustus Castle under [[Hieronymus Lotter]]. In the years 1563-1569 he was able to switch from Paul Widemann the contract for the construction of the choir of St. Mary at Zwickau secure along with his brother Philipp Hoffmann.

This was followed by the construction of the town hall in [[Schweinfurt]] between 1569 to 1572. This was his main work on the room grouping, façade and detail processing and deemed a feat of German Renaissance art. In 1570 he refereed in Rothenburg with their Town Hall building.

==Legacy==
In Hof, there is a street named after Hoffman, Nikolaus Hoffman Street; Nickel Hoffmann street is another street in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

'''Donato Bramante''' (1444&amp;nbsp;– 11 March 1514),{{sfnp|Davies &amp; al.|1996|p=642}} born as '''Donato di Pascuccio d'Antonio'''{{fact|date=June 2016}} and also known as '''Bramante Lazzari''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=213}}{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=418}} was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[architect]]. He introduced [[Renaissance architecture]] to [[Milan]] and the [[High Renaissance]] style to [[Rome]], where his plan for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] formed the basis of design executed by [[Michelangelo]].  His [[Tempietto]] ([[San Pietro in Montorio]]) marked the beginning of the High Renaissance in Rome (1502) when [[Pope Julius II]] appointed him to build a sanctuary over the spot where [[Saint Peter|Peter]] was allegedly crucified.

{{anchor|Biography|History}}
==Life==
===Urbino===
Bramante was born under the name '''Donato d'Augnolo''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=418}} Donato di Pascuccio d'Antonio, or Donato Pascuccio d'Antonio{{fact|date=June 2016}} in [[Fermignano]] near [[Urbino]]. Here, in 1467, [[Luciano Laurana]] was adding to the [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino|Palazzo Ducale]] an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] [[courtyard]] and other Renaissance features to [[Federico da Montefeltro]]'s ducal palace. Bramante's architecture has eclipsed his painting skills: he knew the painters [[Melozzo da Forlì]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] well, who were interested in the rules of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and illusionistic features in [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s painting. 

===Milan===
Around 1474, Bramante moved to [[Milan]], a city with a deep Gothic architectural tradition, and built several churches in the new Antique style. The Duke, [[Ludovico Sforza]], made him virtually his court architect, beginning in 1476, with commissions that culminated in the famous [[trompe-l'oeil]] choir of the church of [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]] (1482–1486). Space was limited, and Bramante made a theatrical [[apse]] in [[bas-relief]], combining the painterly arts of perspective with Roman details. There is an octagonal sacristy, surmounted by a [[dome]]. In Milan, Bramante also built the tribune of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] (1492–99); other early works include the [[Cloisters of Sant'Ambrogio]], Milan (1497–1498), and some other constructions in [[Pavia]] and possibly [[Legnano]]. However, in 1499, with his Sforza patron driven from Milan by an invading French army, Bramante made his way to Rome, where he was already known to the powerful [[Riario|Cardinal Riario]].

===Rome===
In Rome, he was soon recognized by [[Cardinal Della Rovere]], shortly to become [[Pope Julius II]]. For Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile or possibly Julius II, Bramante designed one of the most harmonious buildings of the [[Renaissance]]: the [[Tempietto]] (1510) of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] on the [[Janiculum]]. Despite its small scale, the construction has all the rigorous proportions and symmetry of Classical structures, surrounded by slender Doric columns, surmounted by a dome. According to a later engraving by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], Bramante planned to set it within a colonnaded courtyard. In November 1503, Julius engaged Bramante for the construction of the grandest European architectural commission of the 16th century, the complete rebuilding of [[St Peter's Basilica]]. The cornerstone of the first of the great piers of the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]] was laid with ceremony on 17 April 1506. Very few drawings by Bramante survive, though some by his assistants do, demonstrating the extent of the team which had been assembled. Bramante's vision for St Peter's, a centralized Greek cross plan that symbolized sublime perfection for him and his generation (compare [[Santa Maria della Consolazione (Todi)|Santa Maria della Consolazione]] at [[Todi]], influenced by Bramante's work) was fundamentally altered by the extension of the [[nave]] after his death in 1514. Bramante's plan envisaged four great chapels filling the corner spaces between the equal [[transept]]s, each one capped with a smaller dome surrounding the great dome over the crossing. So Bramante's original plan was very much more Romano-Byzantine in its forms than the basilica that was actually built. (See [[St Peter's Basilica]] for further details.){{fact|date=June 2016}}

Bramante also worked on several other commissions. Among his earliest works in Rome, before the Basilica's construction was under way, is the cloister (1500–1504) of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] near [[Piazza Navona]].{{fact|date=June 2016}}

'''Girolamo Cassar''' ({{lang-mt|Ġlormu Cassar}}, {{circa}} 1520 – {{circa}} 1592) was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] architect and military engineer. He was the resident engineer of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]], and was admitted into the Order in 1569. He was involved in the construction of [[Valletta]], initially as an assistant to [[Francesco Laparelli]], before taking over the project himself. He designed many public, religious and private buildings in the new capital city, including [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]], the [[Grandmaster's Palace (Valletta)|Grandmaster's Palace]] and the [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)#Auberges in Malta|auberges]].

He was the father of [[Vittorio Cassar]], another architect and engineer.

==Biography==
Cassar's date of birth is not known, but he is believed to have been born in around 1520 in either [[Birgu]] or [[Gudja]], to a Sicilian family who had lived in the Maltese islands since around 1440.&lt;ref name=&quot;melitensiawth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mangion|first1=Giovanni|title=Girolamo Cassar Architetto maltese del cinquecento|journal=Melita Historica|date=1973|volume=6|issue=2|pages=192–200|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.06(1972-75)/MH.6(1972)2/orig07.pdf|publisher=Malta Historical Society|language=Italian|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20160416133159/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.06(1972-75)/MH.6(1972)2/orig07.pdf|archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassar was initially a ''capomastro'' (master builder), and he was a pupil of [[Evangelista Menga]], the resident engineer of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]]. He worked as a military engineer during the [[Battle of Djerba]] in 1560 and the [[Great Siege of Malta]] in 1565. During the latter siege, he worked on repairing fortifications damaged by the Ottoman assaults, sometimes at great personal risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. 1 A–F|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|pages=520–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1566, the Order decided to construct a new capital city [[Valletta]], and Cassar became the assistant of [[Francesco Laparelli]], the Italian military engineer who had been sent to design the [[fortifications of Valletta|city's fortifications]] and [[grid plan]]. On 22 April 1569, Cassar was received within the Order in recognition of his merits as an architect and engineer. At this point, the Grand Master issued him a passport and Cassar spent the rest of the year touring Italian cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;/&gt; including [[Naples]], [[Rome]] and [[Lucca]]. He became familiar with the [[Mannerism (architecture)|Mannerist style]] during this tour, and he employed this style in many of his later buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellul|first1=Michael|title=In search of Girolamo Cassar: An unpublished manuscript at the State Archives of Lucca|journal=Melita Historica|date=2004|volume=XIV|issue=1|page=37|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2004)1/02.pdf|issn=1021-6952|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20160313191703/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2004)1/02.pdf|archivedate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auberge d'Aragon.jpg|thumb|[[Auberge d'Aragon]], the only auberge which still retains Cassar's original design, with the only addition being a 19th-century [[portico]]]]

Upon his return to Malta in around late 1569, work on the Valletta fortifications was almost completed, and he took over the project after Laparelli left the island. He also became the Order's resident architect and engineer. He designed many public, religious and private buildings within the city, including the [[Grandmaster's Palace (Valletta)|Grandmaster's Palace]], the seven original [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)#Auberges in Malta|auberges]] and the Conventual Church of St. John (now known as [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]]). Cassar also designed a few buildings outside the capital city, most notably the [[Verdala Palace]] in [[Buskett]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;/&gt;

The date and circumstances of Cassar's death are not recorded. He made his second will on 9 January 1589. He is believed to have died in around 1592 in Valletta. He was buried in the [[Basilica of St Dominic, Valletta|Church of Porto Salvo]] in the same city.&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==

Many of Cassar's buildings were altered or demolished between the 17th and the 20th centuries, and very few buildings still retain his original design. The only auberge in Valletta retaining Cassar's façade is [[Auberge d'Aragon]], with the only alteration being a portico which was added to the main doorway in the 19th century. Other buildings which retain Cassar's exterior design include [[Saint John's Co-Cathedral]] in Valletta and the Church of St. Mark in Rabat, although their interiors were altered over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Façade of church dedicated to St Mark in Rabat to be restored|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2016-06-30/local-news/Facade-of-church-dedicated-to-St-Mark-in-Rabat-to-be-restored-6736160244|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=30 June 2016|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20160701131243/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2016-06-30/local-news/Facade-of-church-dedicated-to-St-Mark-in-Rabat-to-be-restored-6736160244|archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Malta's independence in 1964, the road leading from [[Floriana]] to Castille Square in Valletta was renamed from Duke of York Avenue to Girolamo Cassar Avenue ({{lang-mt|Triq Girolamo Cassar}}) after the architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chetcuti|first1=Kristina|title=Where the streets have four names|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150601/local/where-the-streets-have-four-names.570511|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=1 June 2015|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20160719173335/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150601/local/where-the-streets-have-four-names.570511|archivedate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tommaso Dingli''' ({{lang-mt|Tumas Dingli}}, 22 December 1591 – 28 January 1666) was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] architect and sculptor. One of the last [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] architects on the island, he designed several parish churches, most notably those of [[Parish Church of St. Mary, Attard|Attard]] and [[Parish Church of St. Mary, Birkirkara|Birkirkara]].

==Biography==
Tommaso Dingli was born on 22 December 1591 in [[Attard]], and he was the son of the sculptor Giacobo Dingli and his wife Katerina Dingli née Tabone.&lt;ref name=&quot;attard-parish&quot;/&gt; He was the fourth of ten children, and one of his brothers was the artist [[Filippo Dingli]]. Dingli began his career as a ''scarpellino'' (stone carver) with his father Giacobo and his uncle, the engineer Andrea Dingli.&lt;ref name=&quot;phw&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Parish-church-attard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Parish Church of St. Mary, Attard|Parish Church of St. Mary]] in [[Attard]]]]

In his early career as an architect, Dingli assisted the ''capomastro'' (master builder) [[Giovanni Attard]] during the construction of the [[Wignacourt Aqueduct]] between 1610 and 1614. In later years, Dingli obtained a number of commissions and he designed a number of parish churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;phw&quot;/&gt; In 1633, Dingli is attributed to have designed the [[City Gate (Valletta)#Second City Gate|second ''Porta Reale'']], the main [[city gate]] of the capital [[Valletta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;portareale&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Many pasts of City Gate|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2009-01-11/opinions/the-many-pasts-of-city-gate-218738/|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=11 January 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20160417014039/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2009-01-11/opinions/the-many-pasts-of-city-gate-218738/|archivedate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1639, Giovanni de’ Medici was impressed with Dingli's abilities and offered to take him to Italy, but he declined since his service was in demand within Malta.&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiavone|first1=Michael J.|title=Dictionary of Maltese Biographies Vol. 1 A–F|date=2009|publisher=Pubblikazzjonijiet Indipendenza|location=[[Pietà, Malta|Pietà]]|isbn=9789993291329|pages=731–732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dingli died on 28 January 1666 at the age of 74, and he was buried at the Attard parish church, which he had designed himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;phw&quot;/&gt;

Most of Dingli's churches were built in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], and they might have had influences from the Spanish [[Plateresque]]. He was one of the last Renaissance architects in Malta, and the [[Maltese Baroque architecture#Seventeenth century|Baroque style]] became popular in the years after his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;phw&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thake|first1=Conrad|title=Influences of the Spanish Plateresque on Maltese Ecclesiastical Architecture|journal=Proceedings of History Week|date=2013|pages=63–73|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW2013/05s.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728171614/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Proceedings%20of%20History%20Week/PHW2013/05s.pdf|archivedate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings attributed to Dingli==
[[File:Chiesa di Santa Maria.jpg|thumb|[[Parish Church of St. Mary, Birkirkara|Parish Church of St. Mary]] in [[Birkirkara]], which was designed (at least in part) by Dingli]]

Dingli is best known for his ecclesiastical architecture. Churches which are known to have been designed by him include:&lt;ref name=&quot;phw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;/&gt;
*[[Parish Church of St. Mary, Birkirkara|Parish Church of St. Mary]] in [[Birkirkara]] – probably in collaboration with other architects
*Parish Church of the Assumption in [[Mosta]]
*[[Parish Church of St. Mary, Attard|Parish Church of St. Mary]] in [[Attard]]
*[[Church of the Nativity of Mary, Naxxar|Parish Church of the Nativity of Mary]] in [[Naxxar]]
*Parish Church of St. Bartholomew in [[Għargħur]]
*Parish Church of Our Lady of Grace in [[Żabbar]]
*[[Church of St Philip of Agira, Ħaż-Żebbuġ|Parish Church of St. Philip of Agira]] in [[Żebbuġ]] – in collaboration with other architects
*Church of the Madonna tal-Għar at [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]]
*Sacristy of [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina|St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[Mdina]]
Most of these were altered or destroyed in subsequent centuries, for example the Mosta parish church was demolished in the 19th century to make way for the [[Rotunda of Mosta]]. Only the Birkirkara and Attard parish churches still retain Dingli's original design.&lt;ref name=&quot;phw&quot;/&gt;
