      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2159">A '''French curve''' is a template usually made from [[metal]], [[wood]] or [[plastic]] composed of many different [[curve]]s. It is used in manual [[Technical drawing|drafting]] to draw smooth curves of varying radii. The shapes are segments of the [[Euler spiral]] or clothoid curve. The curve is placed on the drawing material, and a [[pencil]], [[knife]] or other implement is traced around its curves to produce the desired result.

== Modern successors ==
Modern computer-aided drafting ([[CAD]]) systems use vector-based graphics to achieve a precise [[radius]], so no template is required.  Digital computers can also be used to generate a set of coordinates that accurately describe an arbitrary curve, and the points can be connected with line segments to approximate the curve with a high degree of accuracy.  Some computer-graphics systems make use of [[Bézier curve]]s, which allow a curve to be bent in real time on a display screen to follow a set of coordinates, much in the way a French curve would be placed on a set of three or four points on paper.

[[File:Watt Parallel Motion Simulation.gif|right|thumb|Animation of [[James Watt|Watt]]'s parallel motion]]
The '''parallel motion''' is a [[linkage (mechanical)|mechanical linkage]] invented by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[engineering|engineer]] [[James Watt]] in 1784 for the [[double-acting cylinder|double-acting]] [[Watt steam engine]]. It allows a rod moving straight up and down to transmit motion to a beam moving in an arc, without putting sideways strain on the rod.

==Description==
[[Image:WattParallelMotion.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Watt|Watt]]'s parallel motion on a pumping engine]]
In previous engines built by [[Thomas Newcomen|Newcomen]] and Watt, the [[piston]] pulled one end of the walking beam downwards during the power stroke using a [[Link chain|chain]], and the weight of the pump pulled the other end of the beam downwards during the recovery stroke using a second chain, the alternating forces producing the rocking motion of the beam. In Watt's new double-acting engine, the piston produced power on both the upward and downward strokes, so a chain could not be used to transmit the force to the beam. Watt designed the parallel motion to transmit force in both directions whilst keeping the piston rod vertical. He called it &quot;parallel motion&quot; because both the piston and the pump rod were required to move vertically, parallel to one another.

[[Image:The Kinematics of Machinery Fig 1.png|thumb|left|Hand-drawn diagram in [[James Watt]]'s letter to his son.&lt;ref name=&quot;watt1808&quot; /&gt;]]
In a letter to his son in 1808 describing how he arrived at the design, James Watt wrote &quot;I am more proud of the parallel motion than of any other invention I have ever made.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;watt1808&quot;&gt;Franz Reuleaux, ''The Kinematics of Machinery'' (1876), [[s:Page:The Kinematics of Machinery.djvu/26|page 4]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch he included actually shows what is now known as [[Watt's linkage]] which was a linkage described in Watt's 1784 patent but it was immediately superseded by the parallel motion.&lt;ref name=ferguson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Eugene S.|coauthors=228, paper 27, pp. 185-230|title=Kinematics of Mechanisms from the Time of Watt|journal=United States National Museum Bulletin|year=1962|volume=228|pages=185–230|url=http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=kmoddl;cc=kmoddl;view=toc;subview=short;idno=kmod009|accessdate=12 May 2013}} Also available at https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27106/27106-h/27106-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The parallel motion differed from Watt's linkage by having an additional pantograph linkage incorporated in the design. This did not affect the fundamental principle but it allowed the engine room to be smaller because the linkage was more compact.&lt;ref name=ferguson /&gt;

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:watt-parallel-motion.svg|right|thumb|Schematic of [[Watt]]'s parallel motion]]
See the diagram on the right. '''A''' is the journal (bearing) of the walking beam '''KAC''', which rocks up and down about '''A'''. '''H''' is the piston, which is required to move vertically but not horizontally. The heart of the design is the four-bar linkage consisting of '''AB''', '''BE''' and '''EG''' and the base link is '''AG''', both joints on the framework of the engine. As the beam rocks, point '''F''' (which is drawn to aid this explanation, but which is not visible on the machine itself) describes an elongated figure-of-eight (more precisely, a [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]]) in mid-air. Since the motion of the walking beam is constrained to a small angle, '''F''' describes only a short section of the figure-of-eight, which is quite close to a vertical straight line. The figure-of-eight is symmetrical as long as arms '''AB''' and '''EG''' are equal in length, and straightest when the ratio of '''BF''' to '''FE''' matches that of '''AB''' to '''EG'''. If the stroke length (that is, the maximum travel of ''F'') is '''S''', then the straight section is longest when '''BE''' is around 2/3 '''S''' and '''AB''' is 1.5 '''S'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mechanisms2001&quot;&gt;Neil Sclater and Nicholas P. Chironis, ''Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook Third Edition'' (2001), page 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

It would have been possible to connect '''F''' directly to the piston rod (the &quot;Watt's linkage&quot; design), but this would have made the machine an awkward shape, with '''G''' a long way from the end of the walking beam. To avoid this, Watt added the parallelogram linkage BCDE to form a [[pantograph]]. This guarantees that '''F''' always lies on a straight line between '''A''' and '''D''', and therefore that the motion of '''D''' is a magnified version of the motion of '''F'''. '''D''' is therefore the point to which the piston rod '''DH''' is attached. The addition of the pantograph also made the mechanism shorter and so the building containing the engine could be smaller.

As already noted, the path of '''F''' is not a perfect straight line, but merely an approximation. Watt's design produced a deviation of about one part in 4000 from a straight line. Later, in the 19th century, perfect straight-line linkages were invented, beginning with the [[Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage]] of 1864.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3376">'''Product and manufacturing information''', also abbreviated '''PMI''', conveys non-geometric attributes in 3D [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[Collaborative Product Development]] systems necessary for manufacturing product components and assemblies. PMI may include  [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing|geometric dimensions and tolerances]], 3D annotation (text) and dimensions, surface finish, and material specifications.  PMI is used in conjunction with the 3D model within [[model-based definition]] to allow for the elimination    of 2D drawings for data set utilization.

==Uses and visualization==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The PMI annotation is created on the 3D CAD model, associated to edges and faces, and can be exported into neutral formats such as [[ISO 10303]] STEP and 3D PDF.  This information can then be used by a number of down-stream processes. PMI can be used to generate annotation on a traditional 2D drawing the data.  However, generally, PMI is used to visualized product definition within the 3D model, thus removing the need for drawings. Some 3D model formats enable [[computer-aided manufacturing]] software to access PMI directly for [[CNC]] programming. The PMI also may be used by tolerance analysis and [[Coordinate-measuring machine]] (CMM) software applications if the modeling application permits.

PMI items are often organized within annotation views. Annotation views typically view including camera/view position, selected  and also the particular state of the assembly (visibility, rendering mode, sometime even position of each element of the assembly). CAD applications have different notions of PMI Views (for instance &quot;Capture Views&quot; and &quot;Annotation 
Views&quot; are specific to Dassault Systems [[CATIA]], etc.).

For anyone to be able to display any kind of PMI View, [[Adobe Systems]] has unified their format and added their description to the [[PDF]] format (version 1.7).

==Communication deliverables==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
In an effort to unify the visualization of PMI across the different existing solutions, [[Adobe Systems]] has released a version of the Myriad CAD font that allows display of PMI information from almost any CAD application.  Similarly, [[Siemens PLM Software]] offers downloadable font sets for multiple languages such as for Asian character sets.  The  [[ISO 10303]] STEP standards also handle a wide range of PMI information.

==Standards==
Industry standards for defining PMI include [[ASME Y14.41-2003| ASME Y14.41-2003 Digital Product Data Definition Practices]] and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 1101:2004 Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) -- Geometrical tolerancing—Tolerances of form, orientation, location and run-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ISO Products, Standards |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=1147 |publisher=ISO TC 213 Dimensional and geometrical product specifications and verification |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''CAD''''' stands for any of
:[[Computer-aided design]]
:Computer-aided drafting
:Computer-aided drawing
and it may also be found as '''''CADD''''' referring to drafting and design.
The acronym '''''CAD''''' may be coupled with '''''CAM''''' as in [[CAD/CAM]]), which stands for any of
:Computer-aided modeling (or [[solid modeling]])
:[[Computer-aided manufacturing]]
and can be coupled with computer-aided analysis and Computer Numeric Control [[CNC]].

The entire process is called [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">'''Architectural rendering''', or '''architectural illustration''', is the art of creating two-dimensional images or animations showing the attributes of a proposed [[architecture|architectural]] design.

[[File:sacstore.jpg|right|frame|Architectural rendering of an [[A&amp;P]] [[Sav-A-Center]] supermarket plaza, commonly built in Canada and the United States in the 1980s-1990s]]

==Computer-generated renderings==
Images that are generated by a computer using three-dimensional modeling software or other computer software for presentation purposes are commonly termed &quot;Computer Generated Renderings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is Architectural Rendering? (with pictures)|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-architectural-rendering.htm|accessdate = 2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rendering techniques vary. Some methods create simple flat images or images with basic shadows. A popular technique uses sophisticated software to approximate accurate lighting and materials. This technique is often referred to as a &quot;Photo Real&quot; rendering. Renderings are usually created for presentation, marketing and design analysis purposes.

*Still renderings
*3D Walk through and fly by animations (movie)
*Virtual Tours
*Floor Plans
*Photo realistic 3D Rendering
*Realtime 3D Renderings
*Panoramic Renderings
*Light and Shadow ([[sciography]]) study renderings
*Renovation Renderings (photomontage)
*and others

3D renderings play a major role in real estate sales. It also makes it possible to make design related decisions well before the building is actually built. Thus it helps experimenting with building design and its visual aspects.

==Hand-drawn renderings or architectural illustration==
Until 3D computer modeling became common, most architectural renderings were created by hand. There are still many architectural illustrators who create renderings entirely by hand. Some hand illustrators use a combination of hand and computer generated linework. Common mediums for hand architectural renderings include:

*Watercolor
*Markers
*Color Pencil
*Pen and Ink
*Acrylics

==Awards==
*The [[Hugh Ferriss Memorial Prize]] is awarded by the American Society of Architectural Illustrators in recognition of excellence in the graphic representation of architecture. It is the Society's highest award.
*The CGarchitect Architectural 3D Awards are awarded by CGarchitect.com in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] architectural rendering. The awards were started in 2004 and award in five main categories: Best Architectural Image, Best Architectural Film, Best Student Image, Best Student Film, Best Interactive Presentation/Emerging Technology.

==Education==
Traditionally rendering techniques were taught in a &quot;master class&quot; practice (such as the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]), where a student works creatively with a mentor in the study of fine arts. Contemporary architects use hand-drawn sketches, pen and ink drawings, and watercolor renderings to represent their design with the vision of an artist. Computer generated [[graphics]] is the newest medium to be utilized by architectural [[illustrator]]s.

KG (2007)''&lt;/ref&gt; It also produces plastic [[eraser]]s, [[ruler]]s, compasses and other drawing/writing accessories. Staedtler claims to be the largest European manufacturer of [[Pencils|wood-cased pencils]], [[Overhead projector|OHP]] pens, [[mechanical pencil]] [[Pencil lead|leads]], [[erasers]], and [[modelling clay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Company Profile.&quot; STAEDTLER. N.p., n.d. Web. 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Staedtler has over 20 global subsidiaries and seven manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoovers.com ''© 2007, Hoover's, Inc., All Rights Reserved ''&lt;/ref&gt; Over 85% of the production takes place in the headquarters in Nuremberg, though some of its products are made in Japan.  Its &quot;Noris&quot; line of pencils are extremely common in [[United Kingdom|British]] schools.

==History==
The name Staedtler (stylized as STAEDTLER) is closely linked with Nuremberg's pencil history. Long before J.S. Staedtler founded his pencil making factory within Nuremberg's old city walls back in 1835, the Staedtler family had already been hand-making this well-loved writing instrument for generations.

The roots of the name Staedtler can be traced back to 1662, the year in which the first references to Friedrich Staedtler as a pencil-making craftsman were made in the city annuals. On 3 October 1835, J.S. Staedtler received permission from the municipal council to produce blacklead, red chalk and pastel pencils in his industrial plant. In 1866, the company had 54 employees and produced 15,000 gross (2,160,000 pencils) per year.

Between 1900 and 1901 the ''Mars'' and ''Noris'' brands were created. In 1922 the US subsidiary (located in New York) was established, which was followed by the Japan subsidiary four years later. In 1937 the name was changed to ''Mars Pencil and Fountain Pen Factory'' and the product range was expanded to include mechanical writing instruments. In 1949 began the production of [[ballpoint pen]]s, which began to be widely used instead of [[fountain pens]] (although Staedtler still produces the latter today).

In 1950 propelling pencils (or [[mechanical pencil]]s) began to be manufactured, the first being made out of [[wood]]. Four years later, the &quot;Lumocolor&quot; brand was registered. This brand was used to design the wide range of Staedtler [[Marker pen|markers]]. In 1962 [[Technical pen]]s began to be produced.
 
As from 2010, [[FIMO]], MALI, Aquasoft and further brands are being marketed under the Staedtler name.  In addition, the company celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staedtler History&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Caroline|title=Staedtler and Faber-Castell's Productive Pencil Rivalry|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13019777|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=BBS News|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Views}}
A '''bird's-eye view''' is an elevated view of an object from above, with a [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] as though the [[observation|observer]] were a [[bird]], often used in the making of [[blueprints]], [[floor plan]]s and [[maps]].

It can be an aerial photograph, but also a drawing. Before manned flight was common, the term &quot;bird's eye&quot; was used to distinguish views drawn from direct observation at high locations (for example a mountain or tower), from those constructed from an imagined (bird's) perspectives. Bird's eye views as a genre have existed since classical times. The last great flourishing of them was in the mid-to-late 19th century, when bird's eye view prints were popular in the United States and Europe.

== Terminology ==
[[File:Friedhof Melaten in Köln (23785443871).jpg|thumb|Aerial Viewpoint Melaten in [[Köln]]]]
The terms '''aerial view''' and '''aerial viewpoint''' are also sometimes used synonymous with bird's-eye view. The term ''aerial view'' can refer to any view from a great height, even at a wide angle, as for example when looking sideways from an airplane window or from a mountain top. '''Overhead view''' is fairly synonymous with ''bird's-eye view'' but tends to imply a less lofty vantage point than the latter term. For example, in computer and video games, an &quot;overhead view&quot; of a character or situation often places the vantage point only a few feet (a meter or two) above human height. See [[top-down perspective]].

Recent technological and networking developments have made [[satellite image]]s more accessible. Microsoft [[Bing Maps]] offers direct overhead satellite photos of the entire planet but also offers a feature named [[Bing Maps#Bird's-eye view|Bird's eye view]] in some locations. The ''Bird's Eye'' photos are angled at 40 degrees rather than being straight down. Satellite imaging programs and photos have been described as offering a viewer the opportunity to &quot;fly over&quot; and observe the world from this specific angle.

In [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]], a '''bird's-eye shot''' refers to a shot looking directly down on the subject. The perspective is very foreshortened, making the subject appear short and squat. This shot can be used to give an overall [[establishing shot]] of a scene, or to emphasise the smallness or insignificance of the subjects. These shots are normally used for battle scenes or establishing where the character is. It is shot by lifting the camera up by hands or by hanging it off something strong enough to support it. When a scene needs a large area shot, it is a [[crane shot]].

'''T-Square''' is an early [[technical drawing|drafting]] program written by [[Peter Samson]] assisted by [[Alan Kotok]] and possibly [[Robert Alan Saunders|Robert A. Saunders]] while they were students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and members of the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]].

T-Square was written for the [[PDP-1]] computer and its Type 30 precision [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] that [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] donated to MIT in 1961. It is unlikely that many people have had the opportunity to use T-Square although Samson has said the group drew some [[schematics]].

==Authors==
Students of [[Jack Dennis]] and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] discovered a stunning array of uses for the very expensive room-sized computers that were given to MIT. They were privileged to be enrolled when the school's first [[Computer programming|programming]] courses were taught.

They negotiated with their advisors and the operations manager John McKenzie for time and became [[single-user]]s long before [[personal computer]]s were available. About 1959 or 1960, some of this group of students became support staff and wrote software for about $1.75 USD per hour.&lt;ref name=westegg&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote the [[programming software]] which is used to build [[application software]]. Later Samson and Kotok became architects of DEC computers.

==CAD==
During this period Samson created other &quot;firsts&quot; in application software for [[Harmony Compiler|music]], [[Expensive Planetarium|games]] and [[TJ-2|page layout]] so it is perhaps not surprising he wrote what may be the first drafting program. Based on this experience, later in life Samson worked on an electronic drafting program with 80,000 lines of code. He received a patent&lt;ref name=VR&gt;{{cite web

==Input device==
To move the [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]], T-Square used a [[Spacewar!]] [[game controller]] built by Kotok and Saunders in 1962. It is not known if Saunders was involved in repurposing it for T-Square. Kotok, who was about 20 years old, did participate. He was known for doing what needed to be done and for taking an interest in &quot;all things ingenious or intriguing.&quot;&lt;ref name=TBL&gt;{{cite web

[[Ivan Sutherland]] used a [[light pen]] in his programs as did Jack Gilmore and others before him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The pens allow fine detail but drawing on a vertical surface like a CRT tires the hand quickly.

The Spacewar! [http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/spacewar4.jpg control boxes] were cobbled together with wood, [[Bakelite]] and [[toggle switch]]es. Although they are often considered to be the first [[joystick]]s, Kotok did not accept credit for coinventing them with Saunders. He thought there were similar controllers in use at the time in games such as Tennis for Two{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and at NASA or another organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haas&quot;&gt;{{cite web

T-Square is a small part of the reason people use today's computers for drafting, architecture, drawing and illustration and engineering. Prior to this revolution and in some places to this day, draftsmen and women used [[set square|triangles]], wood or metal [[T-square]]s, [[pencils]] and [[technical pen]]s on [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|film]] and [[paper]]. The beginning of this change can be seen in a video of Sutherland demonstrating [[Sketchpad]].&lt;ref name=IES&gt;{{cite web

In his 1963 MIT Ph.D. thesis, Sutherland explains he completed an early version that could draw parallel and perpendicular lines in November 1961. He goes on to say, &quot;Somewhat before my first effort was working, Welden Clark of [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek and Newman]]...&quot; showed him a &quot;similar program&quot; running on a PDP-1.&lt;ref name=IES-thesis&gt;{{cite web | last=Sutherland | first=Ivan Edward | title=Sketchpad: A man-machine graphical communication system (courtesy Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge UCAM-CL-TR-574 September 2003) | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date= January 1963 | url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.html | accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; T-Square and Sketchpad were developed in the same location a year or two apart but their influence on each other is unknown.

[[File:Architectural scale.jpg|thumb|right|A triangular [[architect's scale]]]]
A '''straightedge''' is a tool with an edge free from curves, or straight, used for transcribing straight lines, or checking the straightness of lines. If it has equally spaced markings along its length, it is usually called a [[ruler]].

Straightedges are used in the automotive service and machining industry to check the flatness of machined mating surfaces.

True straightness can in some cases be checked by using a [[laser line level]] as an optical straightedge: it can illuminate an accurately straight line on a flat surface such as the edge of a plank or shelf.

A pair of straightedges called [[winding stick]]s are used in woodworking to amplify twist (wind) in pieces of wood.

== Compass-and-straightedge construction ==
{{Main|Compass and straightedge}}
An idealized straightedge is used in [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s in [[Euclidean geometry|plane geometry]]. 
It may be used:
*Given two points, to draw the line connecting them.
*Given a point and a circle, to draw either tangent.
*Given two circles, to draw any of their common tangents.
It may not be marked or used together with the [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] so as to transfer the length of one segment to another.

It is possible to [[Mohr-Mascheroni theorem|do all compass and straightedge constructions without the straightedge]]. That is, it is possible, using only a compass, to find the intersection of two lines given two points on each, and to find the tangent points to circles. It is not, however, possible to do all constructions using only a straightedge. It ''is'' possible to [[Poncelet–Steiner theorem|do them with straightedge alone given one circle and its center]].

A '''house plan''' is a set of construction or working [[plans (drawings)|drawings]] (sometimes still called [[blueprints]]) that define all the construction specifications of a residential [[house]] such as dimensions, materials, layouts, installation methods and techniques.

==Drawing Set==

The principal information provided in set of house drawings are as follows:

* '''Site plans''' are drawn to show the location of a home on the property in its context. It is an overhead view of the construction site and the home as it sits in reference to the boundaries of the lot. Site plans should outline location of utility services, setback requirements, easements, location of driveways and walkways, and sometimes even topographical data that specifies the slope of the terrain.
*A '''[[floor plan]]''' is an overhead view of the completed house. You'll see parallel lines that scale at whatever width the walls are required to be. Dimensions are usually drawn between the walls to specify room sizes and wall lengths. Floor plans will also indicate rooms, all the doors and windows and any [[wikt:built-in|built-in]] elements, such as [[plumbing]] [[Plumbing fixture|fixture]]s and [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]], water heaters and furnaces, etc. Floor plans will include notes to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items.
*'''[[Elevation (view)|Elevations]]''' are a non-perspective view of the home. These are drawn to scale so that measurements can be taken for any aspect necessary. Plans include front, rear and both side elevations. The elevations specify ridge heights, the positioning of the final fall of the land, exterior finishes, roof pitches and other details that are necessary to give the home its exterior architectural styling.
*A '''[[Cross section (geometry)|section]]''' cuts through the dwelling and the location of this 'cut through' is noted on the floor plan. It describes how the building will be constructed and discusses how the internal finishes are to look. Sections are used because they explain certain conditions in more detail. These conditions may include [[ceiling]] height, ceiling type (flat or [[vault (architecture)|vault]]), and window and door dimensions.
* [[Foundation (architecture)|Foundation]] plan, including dimensions and locations for [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]].
* [[Framing (construction)|Framing]] plan, for wall, including the size of the [[lumber]] to be used - usually 2x4 or 2x6.
* The Sub-floor Plan gives details of how this area will be constructed and how services will be arranged.
* Roof plans, including type, [[Roof pitch|pitch]] and [[Framing (construction)|framing]].
* [[Elevation (view)|Interior elevation]] drawings (interior walls).
* Detail drawings, such as built-in [[shelving]], [[molding (decorative)|molding]]s, and [[column]]s.
* Schedules for elements such as windows and doors.
* Structural layouts.
* Electrical and [[telecommunication|telecoms]] drawings: show locations of all the [[Electrical outlet|outlet]]s, [[TV socket]]s, [[switches]] and fixtures.  Also indicates which switches operate which lights, and where the electric lines should be run,.
* [[Plumbing]] schematic drawing: [[plumbing fixture]]s and [[piping]].

== Lines and symbols ==
House plans use the following lines and symbols to convey the relationship between objects:
* [[Dimension line]]s, which consist of a solid line with a mark at either end; space between the two marks equals the distance noted next to the line.
* [[Wall]] : one uses thick solid lines for [[wall]]s.
* Partial [[height]] wall, low wall that doesn't go all the way to the ceiling.
* Thin solid lines are used for built-in structures (such as [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]], bookshelves, or plumbing fixtures).
* Thin dotted lines indicate overhead features, such as wall cabinets in a kitchen or a special ceiling treatment or an [[arch]]way in the living room.
* [[North arrow]]
* Doors:
** [[Door swing]]
** [[Bifold door]]s
** Passage (hinged) [[door]]s
* [[Sliding glass door]]
* [[Window]]
* [[Toilet]]
* [[Bathtub]]
* [[Shower]]
* Bathroom [[sink]]
* Kitchen sink
* [[Kitchen range]]
* [[Refrigerator]]
* [[Washing machine|Washer]]/[[Clothes dryer|Dryer]]
* Tree
* [[Shrub]]

== Spaces and rooms ==
{{main|Room}}

House plans generally include the following features, depending on the size and type of house:
* [[Patio]]s, [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] or [[veranda]]
* [[Garage (house)|Garage]]
* Formal [[dining room]]
* [[Porch]]
* [[Bedroom]]
* [[Bathroom]]
* [[Kitchen]]
* [[Breakfast]] [[wikt:nook|nook]]
* [[Living room]]
* [[Fireplace]]
* [[Basement]]s
* [[Office]]s
* [[Closet]]s
* [[Den (room)|Den]] ([[Study (room)|study]])
* [[Attic]]s
* [[Hallway]]s, [[Vestibule (architecture)|Vestibule]]
* and other interiors

== Open floorplan ==
An open floorplan is one which values wide, unenclosed spaces. They are made possible by [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] technology, [[engineered wood|engineered lumber]] and [[truss]] systems, and thoughtful structural design which allow for larger clear-spans than formerly possible in residential construction.

An open floor plan limits or excludes walls separating the main living areas of the house (living room, dining room, kitchen) to allow for entertaining or interaction between family.

The '''centrolinead''' was invented by [[Peter Nicholson (architect)|Peter Nicholson]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] and [[architect]], in 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;practical&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Thomas|title=Practical Geometry, Linear Perspective, and Projection: Including Isometrical Perspective, Projections of the Sphere, and the Projection of Shadows, with Descriptions of the Principal Instruments Used in Geometrical Drawing, &amp;c. ...

[[technical drawing|Draftsmen]] could use the instrument in pairs; one for each vanishing point on each side of the [[station point]].

Centrolineads were produced in various sizes. Typically a [[brass]] fitting clamped the [[wood]]en arms together. Fittings were produced in both right and left-handed configuration, and certain adjustable designs could be used on either side.

== Usage ==
Two short arms are set to form 90 degree angles against a third, longer drawing edge. [[Pin (device)|Pins]] are placed near the edges of the drawing surface and serve as pivots for the arms. Pin placement is equidistant and symmetric across the [[horizon|horizontal line]]. A third centrolinead could be used to construct [[Perspective (graphical)#Three-point perspective|3-point perspective]].

The diagram shown above does not represent the centrolinead designed by Nicholson.

[[Image:H op h.PNG|thumb|right|250px|c.t.c. distance]]
'''Centre-to-centre distance''' is a concept for distances, also expressed as heart distance. It is also called pitch.

It is the distance between the centre (the heart) of a column or [[Column|pillar]] and the centre (the heart) of another column or [[Column|pillar]]. By expressing a distance in c.t.c., one can measure distances between [[Column|pillar]] and columns with different diameters without confusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5930">[[Image:Aperture card.JPG|400px|right]]
An '''aperture card''' is a type of '''[[punched card]]''' with a cut-out window into which a chip of '''[[microform|microfilm]]''' is mounted.  Such a card is used for [[archive|archiving]] or for making multiple inexpensive copies of a document for ease of distribution.  The card is typically punched with machine-readable [[metadata]] associated with the microfilm image, and printed across the top of the card for visual identification.  The microfilm chip is most commonly 35mm in height, and contains an [[optics|optically reduced]] image, usually of some type of reference document, such as an [[engineering drawing]], that is the focus of the archiving process.  Aperture cards have several advantages and disadvantages when compared to digital systems.  Machinery exists to automatically store, retrieve, sort, duplicate, create, and digitize cards with a high level of automation.  While many aperture cards still play an important role in archiving, their role is gradually being replaced by digital systems.

== Usage ==
Aperture cards are used for engineering drawings from all engineering disciplines.  The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] once made extensive use of aperture cards, and some are still in use, but most data is now digital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060530111716id_/http://federalvoice.dscc.dla.mil/federalvoice/030924/tech.html Federal use of aperture cards (Archived Copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about the drawing, for example the drawing number, could be both punched and printed on the remainder of the card.  With the proper machinery, this allows for automated handling.  In the absence of such machinery, the cards can still be read by a human with a lens and a light source.

=== Advantages ===
Aperture cards have, for archival purposes, some advantages over digital systems.  They have a 500-year lifetime, they are human readable, and there is no expense or risk in converting from one digital format to the next when computer systems become obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Ed | last = LoTurco | title = The Engineering Aperture Card: Still Active, Still Vital | publisher = EDM Consultants | date = January 2004 | url = http://www.aiimne.org/library/LoTurcoWhitePaper1.pdf | accessdate = October 10, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071128162738/http://www.aiimne.org/library/LoTurcoWhitePaper1.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Most of the disadvantages are related to the well established differences in analog and digital technology. In particular, searching for given strings within content is considerably slower.  Handling physical cards requires proprietary machinery and processing optical film takes significant time.

The very nature of microfilm cameras and the high contrast properties of microfilm stock itself also impose limits on the amount of detail that can be resolved particularly at the higher reduction ratios (36x or greater) needed to film larger drawings. Faded drawings or those of low or uneven contrast do not reproduce well and significant detail or annotations may be lost.

In common with other forms of microfilm mis-filing cards after use, particularly in large archives, results in the card being for all intents and purposes lost forever unless it's later found by accident.

Aperture cards created from 35mm roll film mounted on to blank cards have to be treated with great care. Bending the card can cause the film to detach and excessive pressure to a stack of cards can cause the mounting glue to ooze creating clumps of cards which will feed through duplicators and other machinery either poorly or not at all. Feeding a de-laminated card through machinery not only risks destroying the image it also risks jamming or damaging the machinery.

== Machinery ==
A set of cards could be rapidly sorted by drawing number or other punched data using a [[IBM 80 series Card Sorters|card sorter]].  Machines are now available that [[Image scanner|scan]] aperture cards and produce a digital version.&lt;ref&gt;For example, this aperture card scanner from  [http://www.oceusa.com/main/product_detail.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474395186237&amp;PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524441761057 Oce']&lt;/ref&gt;  Aperture card plotters are machines that use a laser to create the image on the film.&lt;ref&gt;For example, this aperture card plotter from [http://www.wwl.co.uk/apertureplotters.htm Wicks &amp; Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conversion ==
Aperture Cards can be converted to digital documents using scanning equipment and software. The scan software we use allows for significant image cleanup and enhancement. Often, the digital image produced is better than the visual quality available prescan. A variety of output image types can be generated, most notably, Group 4 TIFF and PDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=Joe|title=Aperture Card Scanning|url=http://www.microcomseattle.com/solutions/document-scanning/aperture-card/|website=Micro Com Seattle|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Architect.png|thumb|right|250px|A 19th century architect at the drawing board]]
 
A '''drawing board''' (also '''drawing table''', '''drafting table''' or '''architect's table''') is, in its antique form, a kind of multipurpose [[desk]] which can be used for any kind of drawing, writing or impromptu sketching on a large sheet of paper or for reading a large format [[book]] or other oversized document or for [[technical drawing|drafting]] precise technical illustrations. The drawing table used to be a frequent companion to a [[pedestal desk]] in a gentleman's study or private [[library]], during the pre-industrial and early industrial era.

During the [[Industrial Revolution]] draftsmanship gradually became a specialized trade and drawing tables slowly moved out of the libraries and offices of most gentlemen. They became more utilitarian and were built of steel and plastic instead of fine woods and brass.

More recently, engineers and draftsmen use the drawing board for making and modifying drawings on paper with ink or pencil. Different drawing instruments ([[set square]], [[protractor]], etc.) are used on it to draw parallel, perpendicular or oblique lines. There are instruments for drawing circles, arcs, other curves and symbols too ([[compass (drafting)|compass]], [[French curve]], [[stencil]], etc.). However, with the gradual introduction of computer aided drafting and design (CADD or [[CAD]]) in the last decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century, the drawing board is becoming less common.

A drawing table is also sometimes called a [[mechanical desk]] because, for several centuries, most mechanical desks were drawing tables. Unlike the gadgety mechanical desks of the second part of the 18th century, however, the mechanical parts of drawing tables were usually limited to notches, ratchets, and perhaps a few simple gears, or levers or cogs to elevate and incline the working surface.

Very often a drawing table could look like a [[writing table]] or even a pedestal desk when the working surface was set at the horizontal and the height adjusted to 29&amp;nbsp;inches, in order to use it as a &quot;normal&quot; desk. The only giveaway was usually a lip on one of the sides of the desktop. This lip or edge stopped paper or books from sliding when the surface was given an angle. It was also sometimes used to hold writing implements. When the working surface was extended at its full height, a drawing table could be used as a [[standing desk]].

Many reproductions have been made and are still being produced of drawing tables, copying the period styles they were originally made in during the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Modern-day idiom==
The expression ''&quot;[[wikt:back to the drawing board|back to the drawing board]]&quot;'' is used when a plan or course of action needs to be changed, often drastically; usually due to a very unsuccessful result; e.g., &quot;The battle plan, the result of months of conferences, failed because the enemy retreated too far back. It was back to the drawing board for the army captains.&quot;

The phrase was coined in the caption to a [[w:Peter Arno|Peter Arno]] cartoon of [[w:The New Yorker|The New Yorker]] of March 1, 1941 ([http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/arno11.jpg cartoon])

==Contemporary drafting tables==
[[File:Zeichenmaschine.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing board with [[drafting machine]], eliminating the need for a [[T-square]]]]
[[Image:Drafting table.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A modern drafting table with a parallel motion rule]]
Despite the prevalence of computer aided drafting, many older architects and even some structural designers still rely on paper and pencil graphics produced on a drafting table.  

Modern drafting tables typically rely on a steel frame. Steel provides as much strength as the old oak drafting table frames and much easier portability. Typically the drafting board surface is a thick sheet of compressed fibreboard with sheets of Formica laminated to all its surfaces. The drafting board surface is usually secured to the frame by screws which can easily be removed for drafting table transportation.

The steel frame allows mechanical linkages to be installed that control both the height and angle of the drafting board surface. Typically, a single foot pedal is used to control a clutch which clamps the board in the desired position. A heavy counterweight full of lead shot is installed in the steel linkage so that if the pedal is accidentally released, the drafting board will not spring into the upright position and injure the user. Drafting table linkages and clutches have to be maintained to ensure that this safety mechanism counterbalances the weight of the table surface.

The drafting table surface is usually covered with a thin vinyl sheet called a board cover. This provides an optimum surface for pen and pencil drafting. It allows compasses and dividers to be used  without damaging the wooden surface of the board. A board cover must be frequently cleaned to prevent graphite buildup from making new drawings dirty. At the bottom edge of the table, a single strip of aluminum or steel may serve as a place to rest drafting pencils. More purpose-built trays are also used which hold pencils even while the board is being adjusted.

Various types of [[drafting machine]] may be attached to the board surface to assist the draftsperson or artist. Parallel rules often span the entire width of the board and are so named because they remain parallel to the top edge of the board as they are moved up and down. Drafting machines use pre-calibrated scales and built in protractors to allow accurate drawing measurement.

Some drafting tables incorporate electric motors to provide the up and down and angle adjustment of the drafting table surface. These tables are at least as heavy as the original oak and brass drafting tables and so sacrifice portability for the convenience of push button table adjustment.

'''Archaeological Illustration''' is a form of [[technical illustration]] that records material derived from an [[archaeological]] context graphically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barker 1977&quot;&gt;Barker 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Archaeological Illustration encompasses a number of sub disciplines. These are:

* ''[[Surveying]]'' : To produce an accurate record of sites and buildings and to record accurately where the sites and buildings lie within the landscape. Surveyors use a range of equipment including tapes, [[plane table]]s, [[total station]]s, [[3D scanner]]s, [[GPS]] and [[GIS]] to produce [[illustration]]s including [[Archaeological plan|plans]], [[Archaeological section|sections]] and elevations as well as [[Isometric projection|isometric]] and [[Axonometric projection|axonometric]] illustrations which are regularly used in building recording. Survey data will be gathered on acid free paper, [[Polyvinyl chloride|polyvinyl permatrace]] and archive stable&lt;ref name=&quot;AAF&quot;&gt;[http://www.archaeologists.net/sites/default/files/node-files/ifa_practice_archives.pdf Archaeological Archives Forum report]&lt;/ref&gt; digital formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADS&quot;&gt;Archaeological Data Service digital data standards. [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/project/goodguides/excavation/ Digital Archives from Excavation and Fieldwork: Guide to Good Practice 2nd Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Photography]]'' : To produce a record of archaeological sites, buildings, artifacts and landscapes.

[[Image:LinLogScale.svg|thumb|200px|right|The '''lin-log''' type of a '''semi-log''' graph, defined by a [[logarithmic scale]] on the x axis, and a [[linear]] scale on the y axis. Plotted lines are: ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(red), ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' (green), ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log(''x'')&amp;nbsp;(blue).]]
In [[science]] and [[engineering]], a '''semi-log graph''' or '''semi-log plot''' is a way of visualizing data that are related according to an [[exponential curve|exponential]] relationship. One axis is plotted on a [[logarithmic scale]]. This kind of plot is useful when one of the [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s being plotted covers a large range of values and the other has only a restricted range – the advantage being that it can bring out features in the data that would not easily be seen if both variables had been plotted linearly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intmath.com/Exponential-logarithmic-functions/7_Graphs-log-semilog.php M. Bourne ''Graphs on Logarithmic and Semi-Logarithmic Paper'' (www.intmath.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

All equations of the form &lt;math&gt;y=\lambda a^{\gamma x}&lt;/math&gt; form straight lines when plotted semi-logarithmically, since taking logs of both sides gives

:&lt;math&gt;\log_a y = \gamma x + \log_a \lambda. &lt;/math&gt;

This can easily be seen as a line in slope-intercept form with &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; as the slope and &lt;math&gt;\log_a \lambda&lt;/math&gt; as the vertical intercept.  To facilitate use with logarithmic tables, one usually takes logs to base 10 or e, or sometimes base 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\log (y) = (\gamma \log (a)) x + \log (\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

The term '''log-lin''' is used to describe a semi-log plot with a logarithmic scale on the ''y''-axis, and a [[linear]] scale on the ''x''-axis.  Likewise, a '''lin-log''' plot uses a logarithmic scale on the ''x''-axis, and a [[linear]] scale on the ''y''-axis. Note that the naming is ''output-input'' (''y''-''x''), the opposite order from (''x'', ''y'').

On a semi-log plot the spacing of the scale on the ''y''-axis (or ''x''-axis) is proportional to the logarithm of the number, not the number itself. It is equivalent to converting the ''y'' values (or ''x'' values) to their log, and plotting the data on lin-lin scales. A [[log-log plot]] uses the logarithmic scale for both axes, and hence is not a semi-log plot.

==Equations==
The equation for a line with an ordinate axis logarithmically scaled would be:

:&lt;math&gt; \log_{10}(F(x)) = mx + b &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = 10^{mx + b} = (10^{mx})(10^b). &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of a line on a plot where the abscissa axis is scaled logarithmically would be

:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = m \log_{10}(x) + b. \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Real-world examples==
===Phase diagram of water===
In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], a plot of logarithm of pressure against temperature can be used to illustrate the various [[phase_(matter)#Number_of_phases|phases]] of a substance, as in the following for [[water]]:
[[Image:Phase_diagram_of_water.svg|thumb|none|500px|Log-lin pressure–temperature [[phase diagram]] of water. The [[Roman numeral]]s indicate various [[Ice#Phases|ice phases]].]]

===2009 &quot;swine flu&quot; progression===
While ten is the most common [[base (exponentiation)|base]], there are times when other bases are more appropriate, as in this example:

[[File:Influenza-2009-cases-logarithmic.png|thumb|none|500px|A semi-logarithmic plot of cases and deaths in the [[2009 outbreak of influenza A (H1N1)]].  Notice that while the horizontal (time) axis is linear, with the dates evenly spaced, the vertical (cases) axis is logarithmic, with the evenly spaced divisions being labelled with successive powers of two.]]

===Microbial growth===
In [[biology]] and [[biological engineering]], the change in numbers of [[microbes]] due to [[asexual reproduction]] and nutrient exhaustion is commonly illustrated by a semi-log plot. Time is usually the independent axis, with the logarithm of the number or mass of [[bacteria]] or other microbe as the dependent variable. This forms a plot with four distinct phases, as shown below.

'''Technical lettering''' is the process of forming letters, numerals, and other [[character (computing)|characters]] in [[technical drawing]]. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for, an object. With the goals of [[legibility]] and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability.   [[Engineering drawing]]s use a [[sans-serif|Gothic sans-serif]] script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of [[machine]]s.

==Methods of forming letters==
# ''Freehand lettering'' is done without the assistance of tools. To regulate lettering height, commonly 3&amp;nbsp;mm (⅛ in), [[wiktionary:guideline|guidelines]] are drawn.
# ''Mechanical lettering'' is done using tools such as lettering guides, templates, or using a small mechanical [[pantograph]] referred to by the [[Keuffel and Esser]] trademark &quot;Leroy&quot;
# Modern drawings are lettered with [[computer-aided design]] software.

==Freehand lettering==
[[File:Technical Lettering.jpg|thumb|Technical Lettering. Similar to ISOCP font, available in Autocad.]]
The letters to be drawn, though freehanded, should be stable and graceful. In some cases stability is impossible; for example, ''P'' and ''F'' are unavoidably top-heavy.  In other cases the stability and grace of the letters may be maintained either by drawing the lower parts of the letters like ''B'',''E'' etc. wider than the upper parts, or by drawing the horizontal line at the center of these letters just above their geometric axis. (Exception: In case of the letter ''A'', the horizontal member is drawn below the geometric center, to maintain ''equality of areas below and above the center line''. If a horizontal line is drawn exactly at the center, then the difference in the areas of the triangle above the line and the trapezium below the line is much larger. This creates an unusual effect to our eyes.)

Emphasis should be on the overall beauty of a word, rather than individual letters.

Most freehand lettering is done in a &quot;[[sans-serif|gothic]]&quot; style, i.e., with a constant line thickness; either &quot;straight gothic&quot;, with vertical strokes perpendicular to the baseline, or &quot;inclined gothic&quot;, with vertical strokes at about 75°.

==Mechanical lettering==
[[File:Leroy letter set.jpg|thumb|K &amp; E LEROY lettering set (1959)]]
Mechanical lettering is sometimes done using a [[pantograph]], a device consisting of four bars (&quot;links&quot;) which are pinned to each other to form a [[parallelogram]]. The links can pivot about these pins. The lowermost link of the parallelogram is fixed to two rigid supports. One vertical link at one end is connected to a profile tracer, which traces the profile of the letter to be drawn, and the second vertical link and the other horizontal link are jointly connected to a pencil that draws the exact shape of the profile traced.

==Dimensions of letters==
* ''The Nominal Size of lettering'' is defined by the height (h) of the outline contour of the upper-case (capital).
* ''Central Line'' is the imaginary line in the middle of each line or line element which is a constitutive part of a graphic character set.
* If we consider ''d'' as the width of the line element and ''h'' as the height of the line element, then the two standard ratios for d/h are: 1/14 and 1/10, which are feasible because they result in a minimum number of line thicknesses.
* ''Location of Central Lines'' –  The nominal size (h) and the spacing between characters (a) shall be taken as the basis for defining the central line.
*''Range of Nominal Sizes'' – The nominal size is typically one of the sequence 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 5&amp;nbsp;mm, 7&amp;nbsp;mm, 10&amp;nbsp;mm, 14&amp;nbsp;mm, 20&amp;nbsp;mm.  Successive members of this sequence are approximately in a ratio of the [[square root of 2]], as in the [[ISO 216]] series of [[paper size]]s.
*''Lettering Angle'' – The lettering may be vertical (upright) or inclined (sloped) to the right at 75° from the horizontal.
* The spacing between two characters may be reduced by half, if this gives a better visual effect.
* Various letters are divided into number of parts so that dimensions will be accurate.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} [[File:Lettering.jpg|thumb|Dimensioning of Letters]]
* The size of letter is described by its height. According to the height of letters, they are classified as Lettering A or Lettering B.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}{{cn|date=September 2013}}

An '''exploded view drawing''' is a [[diagram]], [[picture]], schematic or [[technical drawing]] of an object, that shows the relationship or order of [[manufacturing|assembly]] of various parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;&gt;[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (2005), [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/#drawing General Information Concerning Patents § 1.84 Standards for drawings] (Revised January 2005). Accessed 13 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

It shows the components of an object slightly separated by distance, or suspended in surrounding space in the case of a three-[[dimension]]al exploded diagram. An object is represented as if there had been a small controlled [[explosion]] emanating from the middle of the object, causing the object's parts to be separated an equal distance away from their original locations.

The exploded view drawing is used in [[parts catalog]]s, assembly and maintenance manuals and other instructional material.

Usually, the projection of an exploded view is normally shown from above and slightly in diagonal from the left or right side of the drawing. (See exploded view drawing of a gear pump to the right). It is slightly from above and shown from the left side of the drawing in diagonal.

== Overview ==
[[File:Fully assembled view and exploded view.jpg|thumb|left|Fully assembled and exploded view in a  [[patent drawing]]]] 
[[Image:Gear pump exploded.png||thumb|320px|Exploded view drawing of a [[gear pump]]]]

An exploded view drawing is a type of drawing, that shows the intended assembly of mechanical or other parts. It shows all parts of the assembly and how they fit together. In mechanical systems usually the component closest to the center are assembled first, or is the main part in which the other parts get assembled. This drawing can also help to represent the disassembly of parts, where the parts on the outside normally get removed first.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Brumbach, Jeffrey A. Clade (2003). ''Industrial Maintenance''. p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploded diagrams are common in descriptive [[user manual|manual]]s showing parts placement, or parts contained in an assembly or sub-assembly.  Usually such diagrams have the part identification number and a label indicating which part fills the particular position in the diagram.  Many [[spreadsheet]] applications can automatically create exploded diagrams, such as [[Pie chart#Exploded pie chart|exploded pie chart]]s.

In [[patent drawing]]s in an exploded views the separated parts should be embraced by a bracket, to show the relationship or order of assembly of various parts are permissible, see image. When an exploded view is shown in a figure that is on the same sheet as another figure, the exploded view should be placed in brackets.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt;

Exploded views can also be used in [[architectural drawing]], for example in the presentation of landscape design. An exploded view can create an image in which the elements are flying through the air above the [[architectural plan]], almost like a [[cubism|cubist painting]]. The locations can be shadowed or dotted in the siteplan of the elements.&lt;ref&gt;Chip Sullivan (2004) ''Drawing the Landscape''. p.245.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Трансформация переменного движения в непрерывное.jpg|thumb|Exploded view by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]

Together with the [[Cutaway drawing|cutaway view]] the exploded view  was among the many graphic inventions of the [[Renaissance]], which were developed to clarify pictorial representation in a renewed naturalistic way. The exploded view can be traced back to the early fifteenth century notebooks of [[Taccola|Marino Taccola]] (1382–1453), and were perfected by [[Francesco di Giorgio]] (1439–1502) and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519).&lt;ref&gt;Eugene S. Ferguson (1999). ''Engineering and the Mind's Eye''. p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first clearer examples of an exploded view was created by Leonardo in his design drawing of a [[reciprocating motion]] machine. Leonardo applied this method of presentation in several other studies, including those on human anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Laurenza, Mario Taddei, Edoardo Zanon (2006). ''Leonardo's Machines''. p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Exploded View Drawing&quot; emerged in the 1940s, and is one of the first times defined in 1965 as &quot;Three-dimensional (isometric) illustration that shows the mating relationships of parts, subassemblies, and higher assemblies. May also show the sequence of assembling or disassembling the detail parts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Walton (1965). ''Technical Data Requirements for Systems Engineering and Support''. Prentice-Hall. p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pair of compasses''', also known simply as a '''compass''', is a [[technical drawing]] instrument that can be used for inscribing [[circle]]s or [[Arc (geometry)|arcs]]. As [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]], they can also be used as tools to measure distances, in particular on [[map]]s. Compasses can be used for [[mathematics]], [[technical drawing|drafting]], [[navigation]], and other purposes.

Compasses are usually made of metal or plastic, and consist of two parts connected by a hinge which can be adjusted to allow the changing of the radius of the circle drawn. Typically one part has a spike at its end, and the other part a pencil, or sometimes a pen.

Prior to computerization, compasses and other tools for manual drafting were often packaged as a &quot;bow set&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineersupply.com/alvin-speed-bow-compass-set-366s.aspx a current vendor's product]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[interchangeable parts]]. Today these facilities are more often provided by [[computer-aided design]] programs, so the physical tools serve mainly a didactic purpose in teaching [[geometry]], [[technical drawing]], etc.

==Construction and parts==
Compasses are usually made of [[metal]] or [[plastic]], and consist of two parts connected by a [[hinge]] which can be adjusted to allow the changing of the [[radius]] of the [[circle]] drawn. Typically one part has a spike at its end, and the other part a [[pencil]], or sometimes a [[pen]]. 

===Handle===
The handle is usually about half an inch long. Users can grip it between their pointer finger and thumb.

===Legs===
There are two types of legs in a pair of compasses: the straight or the steady leg and the adjustable one. Each has a separate purpose; the steady leg serves as the basis or support for the needle point, while the adjustable leg can be altered in order to draw different sizes of circles.

===Hinge===
The screw on your hinge holds the two legs in its position; the hinge can be adjusted depending on desired stiffness. The tighter the screw the better the compass’ performance.

===Needle point===
The needle point is located on the steady leg, and serves as the center point of circles that are drawn.

===Pencil lead===
The pencil lead draws the circle on a particular paper or material.

===Adjusting nut===
This holds the pencil lead or pen in place.

==Uses==

Circles can be made by fastening one leg of the compasses into the [[paper]] with the spike, putting the pencil on the paper, and moving the pencil around while keeping the hinge on the same [[angle]]. The [[radius]] of the circle can be adjusted by changing the angle of the hinge.

Distances can be measured on a map using compasses with two spikes, also called a [[dividers|dividing compass]]. The hinge is set in such a way that the distance between the spikes on the map represents a certain distance in reality, and by measuring how many times the compasses fit between two points on the map the distance between those points can be calculated.

To use a pair of compasses, place the points on a ruler and open it to the measurement of ½ of the measurement of the circle that you want to draw. For instance, if you desire to draw a 3’’ circle, open the compass to 1 ½ ’’.  Next, place the point (needle) on the spot that you wish the center of your circle to be, and then rotate the section that has the pencil lead around the point, using the handle.

==Compasses and straightedge==
[[Compasses and straightedge constructions]] are used to illustrate principles of [[plane geometry]]. Although a real pair of compasses is used to draft visible illustrations, the ideal compass used in proofs is an abstract creator of perfect circles. The most rigorous definition of this abstract tool is the &quot;collapsing compass&quot;; having drawn a circle from a given point with a given radius, it disappears; it cannot simply be moved to another point and used to draw another circle of equal radius (unlike a real pair of compasses). [[Euclid]] showed in his second proposition (Book I of the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'') that such a collapsing compass could be used to transfer a distance, proving that a collapsing compass could do anything a real compass can do.

==Variants==
A '''[[beam compass]]''' is an instrument with a wooden or brass beam and sliding sockets, or cursors, for drawing and dividing circles larger than those made by a regular pair of compasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728 |title= Beam-Compasses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{ref label|1728|1|^}} --&gt;

'''Scribe-compasses'''&lt;ref&gt;Fine Woodworking, Build a Fireplace Mantel, Mario Rodriquez, pgs. 73, 75, The Taunton Press, No. 184, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; is an instrument used by carpenters and other tradesmen. Some compasses can be used to scribe circles, bisect angles and in this case to trace a line. It is the compass in the most simple form. Both branches are crimped metal. One branch has a pencil sleeve while the other branch is crimped with a fine point protruding from the end. The wing nut serves two purposes, first it tightens the pencil and secondly it locks in the desired distance when the wing nut is turned clockwise.

'''Loose leg wing dividers'''&lt;ref&gt;The Carpenter's Manifesto, Jeffrey Ehrlich &amp; Marc Mannheimer, Holt, Rhinehart &amp; Winston, pg. 64, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  are made of all forged steel. The pencil holder, thumb screws, brass pivot and branches are all well built. They are used for scribing circles and stepping off repetitive measurements&lt;ref&gt;Fine Woodworking, Laying out dovetails, Chris Gochnour, pg. 31, The Taunton Press, No. 190, April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with some accuracy.

A '''[[proportional compass]]''', also known as a military compass or [[sector(instrument)|sector]], was an instrument used for calculation from the end of the sixteenth century until the nineteenth century. It consists of two rulers of equal length joined by a hinge. Different types of scales are inscribed on the rulers that allow for mathematical calculation.

== As a symbol ==
[[File:Nuvola apps designer.svg|left|thumb|75px|A computer drawn compass, used to symbolize precise designing of applications.]]

A pair of compasses is often used as a symbol of precision and discernment. As such it finds a place in logos and symbols such as the [[Freemason]]s' [[Square and Compasses]] and in various [[computer icon]]s. English poet, [[John Donne]] used the compass as a [[conceit]] in &quot;[[A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning]]&quot; (1611).

A '''wall plan''' is a [[drawing]] which consists of complete details with dimensions (with an accuracy of an inch) about all four sides and [[ceiling]] of each and every room in a building. It is drawn with the help of a [[floor plan]] as the basic input.

The main contents in a Wall Plan are:
*Electrical points (like Switch Board Position, Light Position, etc.)
*[[Door]]s and [[window]]s (like position of doors and windows in the wall, etc.)
*[[Wardrobe]]s and [[shelf (storage)|shelves]] (like size and position, etc.)
*[[Plumbing]] points (like [[faucet]] position, [[toilet]] position, [[sink]] position, etc.)
*Electronic points (like [[cable television]] points, [[telephone]] points, [[LAN]] points, etc.)
*Household items (like where to put where)
*[[Aesthetics|Aesthetic]] items (like wall painting, [[clock]], [[mirror]], photos, etc.)
*[[Kitchen]] items (like positioning of [[microwave oven]], [[Water purification|water purifier]], [[chimney]], etc.)

{{Unreferenced|date=February 2009}}[[Image:Plan archaeological.jpg|thumb|240px|fig 1.Typical single context plan]]
In [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]], a '''plan''' is a [[technical drawing|drawn record]] of [[feature (archaeology)|feature]]s and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s in the horizontal plane. 

== Overview ==
Archaeological plan can either take the form of 
* a &quot;multi context&quot; plan, which is drawn with many [[Archaeological context|context]]s on it to show relationships between these features as part of some [[Archaeological phase|phase]], or 
* alternatively a single context plan with a single feature is drawn . 

Excavated features are drawn in three dimensions with the help of drawing conventions such as [[hachures]]. Single context planning developed by the [[Museum of London]] has become the professional norm. The basic advantage of single context planning is context plans draw on &quot;transparent perma-trace paper&quot; can be overlaid for re-interpretation at a later date. 

''Multi-context Plans'' as opposed to single context plans can be made of complete sites, trenches or individual features. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of the plans is usually 1:20. They are linked to the site recording system by the inclusion of known [[grid point]]s and height readings, taken with a [[dumpy level]] or a [[total station]] (see [[surveying]]). Excavation of a site by the removal of human made deposits in the reverse order they were created is the preferred method of excavation and is referred to as stratigraphic area excavation &quot;in plan&quot; as opposed to excavation [[archaeological section|&quot;in section&quot;]]. Plan and section drawings have an interpretive function as well as being part of the recording system, because the draughts-person makes conscious decisions about what should be included or emphasised.

== Archaeological plan topics ==
[[Image:Context planning.jpg|thumb|Fig 2. edge of context conventions]]
[[Image:Cut conventions.jpg|thumb|Fig 3. Cut planning hachures]]
=== The grid ===
It is common and good practice on excavations to lay out a grid of 5m squares so as to facilitate planning. This grid is marked out on-site with grid pegs that form the baselines for tapes and other planning tools to aid the drawing of plans.  It is also common practice that planning is done for each context on a separate piece of perma-trace that conforms to these 5m grid squares.  This is part of the [[single context recording]] system ''(see Fig 1.)'' The site grid should be tied into a national [[geomatic]] database such as the [[Ordnance survey]]

=== Planning drawing conventions ===
Archaeological planners use various symbols to denote characteristics of features and contexts and while conventions vary depending on practitioner, the following are representative:

===Pre-excavation and base plans ===
On  sites with little stratigraphic depth, a pre-excavation multi-context plan is sometimes made of all visible features before any excavation is carried out.  This helps in planning strategy since problems of stratigraphy on rural sites are minimal as [[feature (archaeology)|features]] often [[cut (archaeology)|cut]] into the [[archaeological natural|natural]] minimizing issues of inter-cutting [[feature (archaeology)|features]]. Conversely, planning a multi-context urban site is difficult to achieve on a multi-context plan as the features and deposits when planned will obscure each other on the same planning sheet.

== Critics of pre-excavation planning ==
Pre-excavation plans have been critiqued as being of limited use on urban or deeply stratified sites and have also been attacked in professional archaeology where they have been described as a misused tool of the unscrupulous operators to give the impression the [[archaeological record]] for a given site has been dealt with adequately.

This critical  point of view contends, that  comparisons  between pre and post-excavation plans can demonstrate that a site has not been comprehensively excavated on the basis of a pre-ex plan alone.  In many cases there is a pronounced difference between the two phases of planning.  Although many features may be visible at ground level following machining, it is often the case that the true limits of features are not so initially discernible until the area of the feature is fully cleaned and subsequently excavated revealing further features and [[relationship (archaeology)|relationships]] lower in the [[sequence (archaeological)|sequence]].

A [[patent application]] or [[patent]] may contain [[technical drawing|drawings]], also called '''patent drawings''', illustrating the invention, some of its [[Claim (patent)#Basic types and categories|embodiment]]s (which are particular implementations or methods of carrying out the invention), or the [[prior art]]. The drawings may be required by the law to be in a particular form, and the requirements may vary depending on the jurisdiction.

== Jurisdictions ==

=== Europe ===
Under the [[European Patent Convention]], {{EPC Article|78|1}} provides that a European patent application shall contain any drawings referred to in the description or the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|78|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings are therefore optional. {{EPC Rule|46}} specifies the form in which the drawings must be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Rule|46}}. Examples of European patent applications and drawings in chemistry, electricity/physics, and mechanics are provided in [http://www.epo.org/applying/european/Guide-for-applicants/html/e/ga_aiii.htm ''How to get a European patent, Guide for Applicants, Part 1'', Annex III Examples of European patent applications].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Grant procedure before the European Patent Office#Establishment of a search report|European search report]] is drawn up in respect of a European patent application on the basis of the [[claims under the European Patent Convention|claim]]s, with due regard to the [[description under the European Patent Convention|description]] and any drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the extent of the protection conferred by a European patent or a European patent application is determined by the claims, with the description and drawings being used to interpret the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{EPC Article|69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patent Cooperation Treaty ===
Under the [[Patent Cooperation Treaty]],{{PCT Article|7}} notably provides that the drawings are required when they are necessary for the understanding of the invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Article|7}}. See also {{PCT Rule|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{PCT Rule|11|13}} specifies special physical requirements for drawings in an international application.&lt;ref&gt;{{PCT Rule|11|13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
[[File:TypewriterPatent1868.jpg|thumb|left|240px|1868 patent drawing for the Sholes, Glidden, and Soule [[typewriter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|79265}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the [[United States]], the applicant for a patent is required by law to furnish a drawing of the invention whenever the nature of the case requires a drawing to understand the invention. This drawing must be filed with the application. This includes practically all inventions except compositions of matter or processes, but a drawing may also be useful in the case of many processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |year=2005 |url= http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/#drawing |title=General Information Concerning Patents § 1.84 Standards for drawings (Revised January 2005) |accessdate=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The drawing must show every feature of the invention specified in the [[claim (patent)|claim]]s, and is required by the U.S. [[patent office]] rules to be in a particular form. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) specifies the size of the sheet on which the drawing is made, the type of paper, the margins, and other details relating to the making of the drawing. The reason for specifying the standards in detail is that the drawings are printed and published in a uniform style when the patent issues, and the drawings must also be such that they can be readily understood by persons using the patent descriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt; 

No names or other identification are permitted within the “sight” of the drawing, and applicants are expected to use the space above and between the hole locations to identify each sheet of drawings. This identification may consist of the attorney’s name and docket number or the inventor’s name and application number and may include the sheet number and the total number of sheets filed (for example, “sheet 2 of 4”). The following rule, reproduced from [[title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations]], relates to the standards for drawings:&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt; {{Clarify|date=February 2009}} &lt;!-- Something missing here???--&gt;

==== History ====
[[File:Patent model for loom.jpg|thumb|[[Patent model]] for [[loom]].]]
From 1790 to 1880 in the US, [[patent model]]s were required. A patent model was a scratch-built [[scale model|miniature model]] no larger than 12&quot; by 12&quot; by 12&quot;, approximately 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm, that showed how an invention works. Some inventors still willingly submitted models at the turn of the twentieth century. In some cases, an inventor may still want to present a &quot;working model&quot; as an evidence to prove [[reduction to practice|actual reduction to practice]] in an [[interference proceeding]]. In some jurisdictions patent models stayed an aid to demonstrate the operation of the invention.  In applications involving [[genetics]], samples of genetic material or DNA sequences may be required.

The United States patent law was revised in 1793. It stated that the Commissioner of the USPTO could ask for additional information, drawings, or diagrams if the description is not clear. By then, the rate of patent grants had grown to about 20 per year and the time burden on the Secretary of State was considered to be too burdensome.  Patent applications were no longer examined. Patents were granted simply by submitting a written description of an invention, a model of the invention, if appropriate, and paying a fee of $30 then, and now $1000 in 2006 US dollars.

==== Drawings and photographs ====
In utility and design patent applications, drawings can be in [[ink|black ink]] or color. Black and white drawings are normally required. On rare occasions, color drawings may be necessary as the only practical medium by which to disclose the subject matter sought to be patented in a utility or design patent application or the subject matter of a statutory invention registration.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt; 

Black and white [[photograph]]s are not ordinarily permitted in utility and design patent applications, unless this is the only practicable medium for illustrating the claimed invention. For example, photographs of electrophoresis gels, blots, autoradiographs, cell cultures, histological tissue cross sections, animals, plants, in vivo imaging, etc. Color photographs can be accepted in utility and design patent applications if the conditions for accepting color drawings and black and white photographs have been satisfied.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt;

==== Features ====
[[File:Gillette razor patent.png|thumb|right|280px|[[King Camp Gillette|Gillette]]'s patent drawing of the Razor, 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|775134}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Patent drawing features can contain the following features:&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt; 
* [[Identification (information)|Identification]] of drawings: includes the title of the invention, inventor’s name, and application number.. etc.
* Graphic forms in drawings. Chemical or [[mathematical formulae]], [[Table (information)|table]]s, and [[waveform]]s may be submitted as drawings and are subject to the same requirements as drawings. Each chemical or mathematical formula must be labeled as a separate figure, using brackets when necessary, to show that information is properly integrated.
* Type of [[paper]]: generally flexible, strong, white, smooth, matte (non-shiny), and durable.
* [[Paper size|Size of paper]]: Must be the same size [[A4 paper|DIN size A4]], (8{{fraction|1|2}} by 11&amp;nbsp;inches).
* Some kind of [[Margin (typography)|Margin]] standard.
* [[Graphical projection|View]]s. The drawing must contain as many views as necessary to show the invention. The views may be plan, elevation, section, or perspective views.
* Arrangement of views: All views on the same sheet in the same direction.
* Front page view
* [[Scale (ratio)|Scale]]: large enough to show the mechanism
* [[Shading]]:  aids in understanding the invention used to indicate the surface or shape of spherical, cylindrical, and conical elements of an object.
* [[Symbol]]s: Graphical drawing symbols may be used for conventional elements when appropriate.
* [[Legend]]s: should contain as few words as possible.
* Numbers, letters, and reference characters.
* Lead lines: between the reference characters and the details referred to, and
* [[Arrow]]s: at the ends of lines, provided that their meaning is cleared.
* International drawing formats: Format requirements differ by country where the patent is being filed. Check local patent offices for format requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Drawing Formats&quot;&gt;[http://www.legaladvantage.net/InternationalDrawingFormats.aspx International Drawing Formats]&lt;/ref&gt;

The patent drawing can further contain a numbering of sheets of drawings, numbering of views, [[copyright]] notice, security markings, corrections (durable and permanent), no holes, and a type of drawing indication.

==== Views ====
The views in the drawing may be plan, elevation, section, or perspective views:&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt; 
* [[Exploded view]]s: views with the separated parts embraced by a bracket, to show the relationship or order of assembly of various parts are permissible.
* Partial views: a view of a large machine or device in its entirety may be broken into partial views on a single sheet, or extended over several sheets if there is no loss in facility of understanding the view.
* Sectional views: The plane upon which a sectional view is taken should be indicated on the view from which the section is cut by a broken line.
* Alternate position: A moved position may be shown by a broken line superimposed upon a suitable view if this can be done without crowding; otherwise, a separate view must be used for this purpose, and
* Modified forms. Modified forms of construction must be shown in separate views.

A '''planimeter''', also known as a '''platometer''', is a [[measuring instrument]] used to determine the [[area]] of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape.

==Construction== 
[[Image:Polarplanimeter 01.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Polar planimeter]]
There are several kinds of planimeters, but all operate in a similar way. The precise way in which they are constructed varies, with the main types of mechanical planimeter being polar, linear and Prytz or &quot;hatchet&quot; planimeters. The Swiss [[mathematician]] [[Jakob Amsler-Laffon]] built the first modern planimeter in 1854, the concept having been pioneered by Johann Martin Hermann in 1814.  Many developments followed Amsler's famous planimeter, including electronic versions.

[[Image:Planimeter 02.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A linear planimeter. Wheels permit measurement of long areas without restriction.]]

[[File:Prytz planimeter.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Prytz planimeter with wheel at the left]]

The Amsler (polar) type consists of a two-bar linkage. At the end of one link is a pointer, used to trace around the boundary of the shape to be measured. The other end of the linkage pivots freely on a weight that keeps it from moving. Near the junction of the two links is a measuring wheel of calibrated diameter, with a scale to show fine rotation, and worm gearing for an auxiliary turns counter scale. As the area outline is traced, this wheel rolls on the surface of the drawing. The operator sets the wheel, turns counter to zero, and then traces the pointer around the perimeter of the shape. When the tracing is complete, the scales at the measuring wheel show the shape's area.

When the planimeter's measuring wheel moves perpendicular to its axis, it rolls, and this movement is recorded. When the measuring wheel moves parallel to its axis, the wheel skids without rolling, so this movement is ignored. That means the planimeter measures the distance that its measuring wheel travels, projected perpendicularly to the measuring wheel's axis of rotation. The area of the shape is proportional to the number of turns through which the measuring wheel rotates.

The polar planimeter is restricted by design to measuring areas within limits determined by its size and geometry. However, the linear type has no restriction in one dimension, because it can roll. Its wheels must not slip, because the movement must be constrained to a straight line.

Developments of the planimeter can establish the position of the [[first moment of area]] ([[center of mass]]), and even the [[second moment of area]].

[[Image:NYW-planimeterPolar.png|thumb|right|240px|Polar planimeter]]

The images show the principles of a linear and a polar planimeter. The pointer M at one end of the planimeter follows the contour C of the surface S to be measured. For the linear planimeter the movement of the &quot;elbow&quot; E is restricted to the ''y''-axis. For the polar planimeter the &quot;elbow&quot; is connected to an arm with its other endpoint O at a fixed position. Connected to the arm ME is the measuring wheel with its axis of rotation parallel to ME. A movement of the arm ME can be decomposed into a movement perpendicular to ME, causing the wheel to rotate, and a movement parallel to ME, causing the wheel to skid, with no contribution to its reading.

==Principle of the linear planimeter==
[[Image:MAD-PlanimeterLinBasis01.png|thumb|400px|right|&lt;center&gt;Principle of the linear planimeter]]

The working of the linear planimeter may be explained by measuring the area of a rectangle ABCD (see image). Moving with the pointer from A to B the arm EM moves through the yellow parallelogram, with area equal to PQ&amp;times;EM. This area is also equal to the area of the parallelogram A&quot;ABB&quot;. The measuring wheel measures the distance PQ (perpendicular to EM). Moving from C to D the arm EM moves through the green parallelogram, with area equal to the area of the rectangle D&quot;DCC&quot;. The measuring wheel now moves in the opposite direction, subtracting this reading from the former. The movements along BC and DA are the same but opposite, so they cancel each other with no net effect on the reading of the wheel.  The net result is the measuring of the difference of the yellow and green areas, which is the area of ABCD.

==Mathematical derivation==
The operation of a linear planimeter can be justified by applying [[Green's theorem]] onto the components of the [[vector field]] N, given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\!\,N(x,y)=(b-y,x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is the ''y''-coordinate of the elbow E.

This vector field is perpendicular to the measuring arm EM:

:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{EM}\cdot N = xN_x+(y-b)N_y=0&lt;/math&gt;

and has a constant size, equal to the length ''m'' of the measuring arm:

:&lt;math&gt;\!\,\|N\| =\sqrt{(b-y)^2+x^2}=m&lt;/math&gt;

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \oint_C(N_x \, dx + N_y \, dy) = \iint_S\left(\frac{\partial N_y}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial N_x}{\partial y}\right) \, dx \, dy \\[8pt]
= {} &amp; \iint_S\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial (b-y)}{\partial y}\right) \, dx \, dy = \iint_S  \, dx \, dy = A,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

because:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(y-b) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\sqrt{m^2-x^2} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

The left hand side of the above equation, which is equal to the area ''A'' enclosed by the contour, is proportional to the distance measured by the measuring wheel, with proportionality factor ''m'', the length of the measuring arm.

=== Polar coordinates ===
The connection with Green's theorem can be understood in terms of [[Polar coordinate system#Integral calculus|integration in polar coordinates]]: in polar coordinates, area is computed by the integral &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \int_\theta \tfrac{1}{2} (r(\theta))^2\,d\theta,&lt;/math&gt; where the form being integrated is ''quadratic'' in ''r,''  meaning that the rate at which area changes with respect to change in angle varies quadratically with the radius.

For a [[parametric equation]] in polar coordinates, where both ''r'' and ''θ'' vary as a function of time, this becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\int_t \tfrac{1}{2} (r(t))^2 \, d(\theta(t)) = \int_t \tfrac{1}{2} (r(t))^2\, \dot \theta(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

For a polar planimeter the total rotation of the wheel is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \int_t r(t)\, \dot \theta(t)\,dt,&lt;/math&gt; as the rotation is proportional to the distance traveled, which at any point in time is proportional to radius and to change in angle, as in the circumference of a circle (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \int r\,d\theta = 2\pi r&lt;/math&gt;).

This last integrand &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r(t) \,\dot \theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be recognized as the derivative of the earlier integrand &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tfrac{1}{2} (r(t))^2 \dot \theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; (with respect to ''r''), and shows that a polar planimeter computes the area integral in terms of the ''derivative'', which is reflected in Green's theorem, which equates a line integral of a function on a (1-dimensional) contour to the (2-dimensional) integral of the derivative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1156">A '''structural drawing''', a type of [[Engineering drawing]], is a plan or set of plans for how a building or other structure will be built. Structural drawings are generally prepared by registered professional [[structural engineer]]s, and informed by [[architectural drawing]]s. They are primarily concerned with the load-carrying members of a structure. They outline the size and types of materials to be used, as well as the general demands for connections. They do not address architectural details like surface finishes, partition walls, or mechanical systems. The structural drawings communicate the design of the building's structure to the [[Construction#Authority_having_jurisdiction|building authority]] to review. They are also become part of the contract documents which guide contractors in detailing, fabricating, and installing parts of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.aisc.org/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=25256 AISC Code of Standard Practice]'' AISC 303-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physiognotrace '''or '''physionotrace''': is an instrument designed to trace a person's [[physiognomy]], most specifically the profile in the form of a silhouette: it originated in France where it is known as the [[:fr:Physionotrace|physionotrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Freund, Gisèle | title=Photographie et société | publication-date=1974 | page=8-18| publisher=Éditions du Seuil | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9163895 | accessdate=18 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The instrument is a descendant of the [[pantograph]], a drawing device that magnifies figures.

==History==
A Frenchman named [[Gilles-Louis Chrétien]] invented the &quot;physionotrace&quot; in 1783-84 to aid in the production of [[silhouette]] portraits which became popular during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Chrétien's partner, [[Edme Quenedey]], made a drawing of the instrument in 1788, which now sits in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/bellion.html|title=The Mechanization of Likeness in Jeffersonian America|work=mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrétien's device used the mechanics of the pantograph to transmit the tracing (via an eyepiece) of the subject's profile silhouette to an [[engraving]] needle. Thus it enabled the production of multiple portrait copies.&lt;ref&gt;Cromer 'Le secret du physoniotrace'' Bulletin de la société archéologique, historique et artistique, ´Le Vieux Papier,' 26th year, October 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802, [[John Isaac Hawkins]], who was born in England in 1772 and who lived in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, patented the second official physiognotrace, and partnered with [[Charles Willson Peale]] to market it to prospective buyers. John Hawkins's machine differed from Chrétien's in that it traced around the actual face with a small bar connected to a pantograph that reduced the [[silhouette]] to less than 2&amp;nbsp;inches. At that time, many versions of these instruments were being used all over the East Coast in the United States, some of which predated Hawkins's, and which were capable of quickly making machine-made profiles.&lt;ref&gt;http://206.180.235.133/jaic/articles/jaic41-03-001_5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By 1802, in response to the popularity of silhouettes, which were invented in the late eighteenth century, Peale introduced the British inventor John Hawkins’s (1772–1855) physiognotrace at his museum in Philadelphia. While the operator traced the sitter’s head, the mechanism impressed the image onto a piece of paper that was often folded to produce multiple portraits. The operator then cut away the center of the paper, leaving a “hollow cut” image. These [[silhouette]]s, or profiles as they were also called, could be kept loose, framed, or compiled in albums; a black or blue piece of paper or fabric placed behind the image provided contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=189|title=Distinguishing Real from Fake Peale's Museum Silhouette by user from Antiques &amp; Fine Art magazine|work=antiquesandfineart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peale sent the watercolor sketch of this instrument to [[Thomas Jefferson]],&lt;ref&gt;http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=2539&lt;/ref&gt; along with a detailed explanation. The drawing now sits with the Jefferson Papers in the Library of Congress. In April 1805, Mr. Peale wrote his friend, Dr. [[William Thornton]] to request a certified copy of a patent of a physiognotrace that was issued to John J. Hawkins. Peale, who had an interest in the instrument and who kept the original in his museum, &quot;needed the certified copy to bring suit against a person who was making the device without authority. John J. Hawkins had been in England, where he sold patent rights to the [[polygraph (duplicating device)]] and drawing machine for 1,600 guineas. Mr. Peale also wrote to Dr. Thornton in May 1805 to record an assignment of the Hawkins invention to Mr. Peale for the City of Philadelphia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myoutbox.net/popch08.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Sharples]], an itinerant British portrait artist, who also lived for a time in Philadelphia, used a physiognotrace to draw profiles of such famous subjects as [[George Washington]] and Dolly and [[James Madison]].

[[File:Spline (PSF).png|thumb|right|A spline]]
A '''spline''', or the more modern term '''flexible curve''', consists of a long strip fixed in position at a number of points that relaxes to form and hold a smooth curve passing through those points for the purpose of transferring that curve to another material.

Before computers were used for [[computer-aided design|creating engineering designs]], [[Technical drawing|drafting tools]] were employed by designers drawing by hand. To draw curves, especially for [[shipbuilding]], draftsmen often used long, thin, flexible strips of wood, plastic, or metal called splines (or [[lath]]s, not to be confused with [[lathe]]s). The splines were held in place with lead weights (called ducks because of their [[duck]]-like shape). The [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the spline material combined with the constraint of the control points, or [[Spline (mathematics)#Definition|knots]], would cause the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy required for bending it between the fixed points, this being the smoothest possible shape.

[[File:Krzywik.jpg|thumb|left|A modern flexible curve]]
Splines are more recently referred to as flexible curves and perform much of the original function.  The main difference between splines and flexible curves is that the control points of flexible curves are entirely internal in their housing.  This has one advantage over splines: whereas the draftsman had to first set up the spline and control points before moving the object to be marked to the spline in that order only, with flexible curves the draftsman can also set up the flexible curve before carefully moving the flexible curve to the object to be marked.

One can recreate an original draftsman's spline device with weights and a length of thin stiff plastic or rubber tubing. The weights are attached to the tube (by gluing or pinning). The tubing is then placed over drawing paper. Crosses are marked on the paper to designate the knots or control points. The tube is then adjusted so that it passes over the control points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1946, mathematicians started studying the spline shape and derived the piecewise [[polynomial]] formula known as the [[spline (mathematics)|spline curve]], or spline function. This has led to the widespread use of such functions in [[computer-aided design]], especially in the surface designs of vehicles. [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg|I. J. Schoenberg]] gave the spline function its name after its resemblance to the mechanical spline used by draftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The origins of the spline in wood-working may show in the conjectured etymology, which connects the word ''spline'' to the word ''splinter''. Later craftsmen have made splines out of rubber, steel, and other [[elastomer]]ic materials.

Spline devices help bend the wood for pianos, violins, violas, etc. The [[Wright brothers]] used one to shape the wings of their aircraft.

[[File:1804 Jeffersons-Polygraph-Monticello Cville VA.jpg|thumb|200px|One of the polygraphs used by [[Thomas Jefferson]], a portable version]]

A '''Polygraph''' is a device that produces a copy of a piece of writing simultaneously with the creation of the original, using pens and ink.

Patented by [[John Isaac Hawkins]] on May 17, 1803,&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki.monticello.org&quot;&gt;[http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Polygraph&amp;printable=yes]&lt;/ref&gt; it was most famously used by  the third U.S. president, [[Thomas Jefferson]], who acquired his first polygraph in 1804 and later suggested improvements to [[Charles Willson Peale]], owner of the American rights. Because Jefferson was a prolific letter writer, the preservation of his copies have offered historians extensive insights into Jefferson's viewpoints and actions.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1734 ''The Works of Thomas Jefferson, 12 vols.''] At ''The Online Library of Liberty'' (website of Liberty Fund, Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Jefferson called the polygraph &quot;the finest invention of the present age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Some information and quotation from curator's card, Smithsonian Museum of American History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter: Thomas Jefferson to James Bowdoin, July 10, 1806, Washington – ''Writings of Jefferson 6:7'' The full line is ''&quot;I think it the finest invention of the present age and so much superior to the copying machine that the latter will never be continued a day by any one who tries the polygraph&quot;''. The &quot;copying machine&quot; refers the ''copying press'', which enabled a copy to be made by writing the original using special transferable inks and damp papers to receive the copies. (quoted and described in ''Bedini'', p. 147.)&lt;/ref&gt; A description of Jefferson's office routine in his own words may be read [http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/dayinlife/cabinet/home.html here].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/dayinlife/cabinet/home.html ''&quot;Drudging at the Writing Table&quot;''] (Monticello.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another American, [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] was the first customer of Peale's and not only introduced the device to Jefferson but was also instrumental in its improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, Silvio A. (1984). ''Thomas Jefferson and His Copying Machines''. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia. ISBN 978-0-8139-1025-3, p. 53 et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the copy made by a machine in good condition is so fine that it is considered by some&lt;ref name=raab&gt;[http://www.raabcollection.com/dynamicContent.aspx?key=polygraph ''Thomas Jefferson and the Polygraph''] (The Raab Collection, monograph concerning difficulty of authenticating originals vs. copies in Jefferson's letters: ''&quot;Textual anomalies have not historically been considered as indicators&quot;'')&lt;/ref&gt; that only characteristics other than the quality of the script (''e.g.'', having been mailed, etc.) are reliable indicators (under the assumption that the original was mailed and not the copy), although a worn or maladjusted machine will produce specific indications in the copy.&lt;ref name=raab/&gt;

Mechanisms of this type are more generally known as [[pantograph]]s, which include simple devices for making copies at various enlargements or reductions by tracing over a drawing.

==Description of the device==
[[File:Rees's Cyclopaedia Polygraph.png|thumb|300px|Annotated engraving of Hawkin's Polygraph from [[Rees's Cyclopædia|Rees's ''Cyclopædia'']], ca. 1820]]
For a QuickTime animation see.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/images/media/polygraph.mov Polygraph movie] (requires an appropriate browser plug-in and browser setting) To use this animation, place the cursor on the image, click, and drag. The pens will follow your movement in the writing plane, but pen lift and the pen tilts are not demonstrated.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stationary parts===

====Platform====
The platform forms both a writing surface (in part) and a base and reference plane for the moving and other stationary parts.(''&quot;F&quot; on diagram'') In a portable device the platform is in two parts that form the covers of the enclosure formed for transport. As suggested by Jefferson, a non-portable version uses a single board for the entire platform.

====Bridge====
Also known as a &quot;gallows frame&quot;, the bridge spans the platform (''&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; on diagram''). In the non-portable device this is mounted on posts permanently attached to the platform. In the portable version the bridge, side posts, and a bottom cross piece form the outer rim of enclosure when in the state for transportation.

The bridge divides the platform into two portions, the part toward the user upon which the papers are placed (see illustration above), and the stationary part away from the user that contains a portion of the planar pantograph. The function of the bridge is to form a base for the vertical movement linkage and a support for the suspension spring support beam.

====Inkwells====
Inkwells are provided beneath the bridge for each pen at corresponding locations. The dipping of the master pen will thus re-ink the slave pen.

===Moving parts===
The device consists of two pens transmitting motion in five [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] through four interlinked mechanisms:
#A horizontal pantograph maintains identical planar (X and Y axis) movement, with two degrees of freedom
#An angled pantograph descending from the bridge maintains identical vertical (Z axis) movement
#A torsion beam maintains identical pen fore-and-aft tilt
#A parallel linkage maintains identical pen side-to-side tilt

In addition, a vertical suspension spring balances the weight of the moving parts.

====Planar pantograph====
The range of the planar mechanism must be sufficient to encompass the papers (individually) being written upon  and allow access for each pen to its respective inkwell.

A simple pantograph is used to translate the planar motion of one pen to the other. The pantograph consists of two complete variable [[parallelogram]]s (''&quot;d&quot; and &quot;e&quot; on diagram''):

*Base parallelogram: The base parallelogram is attached to two fixed pivot points at the far side of the base plate. The pivoting arms are supported at their midpoints by wheels which rest on the base and this part remains in a plane parallel to the base.
*Extension parallelogram: The extension parallelogram is attached to the base parallelogram by pivots that allow the pen-side edge to be lifted away from the base.

====Descending pantograph====
A second pair of parallelogram links maintains vertical correspondence between the two pens (''&quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; on diagram''). These consist of two variable parallelogram frames attached at a common edge, one of which is also attached to the bridge, while the other is attached to one of the pen supports at each corner. The projecting sides of the upper frame consist of parallel linkages.

====Pen lift transfer====
The combination of forces between the horizontal and vertical enables the pen lift of the principal pen grasped by the user from the paper to be transferred to the copying pen.

*Pen mounts: Each pen is mounted in such a way that it allows the pen to be used at various angles, necessary to allow a normal writing style. The pens are offset from their pivots by a short stem that projects at right angles from below the midpoint of the pen, allowing the pen to be grasped in whatever way is usual to the user. (''&quot;a&quot; on diagram'')
*Pen tilt (fore and aft): A torsion beam joins the pen mounts to maintain correspondence of tilt with respect to the direction away from the user. (''&quot;G&quot; on diagram'')
*Pen tilt (side-to-side): A parallel linkage maintains correspondence of tilt with respect to a direction parallel to the front face of the device. (''&quot;H&quot; on diagram'')
*Suspension beam and spring: At the center of the bridge a beam projects horizontally toward the user (''&quot;K&quot; on diagram''), from which a vertical suspension spring (''&quot;I&quot; on diagram'')balances most of the weight of the moving parts so that the user is neither fatigued by using the device nor is required to adjust their writing style.

==Viewing in museums==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
Original polygraphs may be viewed at a number of locations around the world.

Some United States locations:
*[[Monticello]], Jefferson's estate in Virginia
*Smithsonian [[National Museum of American History]], Washington, D. C.

==Patent==
The original American patent document for the polygraph, issued to John J. Hawkins on May 17, 1803, was lost in a Patent Office fire in 1836.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki.monticello.org&quot;/&gt;

==A modern version==
The ''Griffin Discovery Room'' at Monticello contains a simplified and durable version, intended for use by children. An image of this version in use may  be seen here.[http://www.monticello.org/featured/8griffin_room.html]

A '''civil drawing''', or '''site drawing''', is a type of [[technical drawing]] that shows information about grading, landscaping, or other site details. These drawings are intended to give a clear picture of all things in a [[construction]] site to a [[civil engineer]].

Civil [[drafter]]s prepare drawings and topographical and relief maps used in major construction or civil engineering projects, such as highways, bridges, pipelines, flood control projects, and water and sewage systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLC07&quot;&gt;[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].

A '''T-square''' is a technical [[plan (drawing)|drawing]] [[Measuring instrument|instrument]] used by [[technical drawing|draftsmen]] primarily as a guide for drawing horizontal lines on a [[drafting table]]. It may also guide a set square to draw vertical or diagonal lines.&lt;ref name = &quot;Drafting 1940&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = United States War Department | title = Topographic Drafting | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | date = 1940 | pages = 27–28 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=3y-7iT046m8C&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name comes from its resemblance to the letter T. T-squares come in varying sizes, common lengths being {{convert|18|inch}}, {{convert|24|inch}}, {{convert|30|inch}}, {{convert|36|inch}} and {{convert|42|inch}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

T-squares are also used to measure and cut [[drywall]]. Drywall T-squares are typically made of [[aluminium]] and have a {{convert|48|inch|adj=on}} long [[tongue]].

Higher-end [[table saw]]s are often equipped with T-square [[fence (woodworking)|fence]]s. These table saw fences are attached to a rail only on the front side of the table unlike traditional fences which clamp to both the front and the rear of the table.

A T-square has two components - the long shaft called the &quot;blade&quot; and the short shaft called the &quot;stock&quot; or &quot;head&quot;. The T-square usually has a [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] edge made of [[plastic]] which should be free of nicks and cracks in order to provide smooth, straight lines.

'''Position Tolerance''' (symbol: &lt;big&gt;'''⌖'''&lt;/big&gt;) is a [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] (GD&amp;T) location control used on [[engineering drawings]] to specify desired location, as well as allowed deviation to the position of a feature on a part. Position tolerance must only be applied to [[feature of size|features of size]], which requires that the feature have at least two opposable points.

'''Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T)''' is a system for defining and communicating [[engineering tolerance]]s. It uses a symbolic language on [[engineering drawing]]s and computer-generated three-dimensional solid models that explicitly describes nominal [[geometry]] and its allowable variation. It tells the manufacturing staff and machines what degree of [[accuracy and precision]] is needed on each controlled feature of the part.
GD&amp;T is used to define the nominal (theoretically perfect) geometry of parts and assemblies, to define the allowable variation in form and possible size of individual features, and to define the allowable variation between features..

*Dimensioning specifications define the nominal, as-modeled or as-intended geometry. One example is a basic dimension.
*Tolerancing specifications define the allowable variation for the form and possibly the size of individual features, and the allowable variation in orientation and location between features. Two examples are [[dimension|linear dimensions]] and feature control frames using a [[datum reference]] (both shown above).

There are several standards available worldwide that describe the symbols and define the rules used in GD&amp;T. One such standard is [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) Y14.5-2009. This article is based on that standard, but other standards, such as those from the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), may vary slightly. The Y14.5 standard has the advantage of providing a fairly complete set of standards for GD&amp;T in one document. The ISO standards, in comparison, typically only address a single topic at a time. There are separate standards that provide the details for each of the major symbols and topics below (e.g. position, flatness, profile, etc.).

== Dimensioning and tolerancing philosophy ==
According to the ASME Y14.5-2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dimensioning and Tolerancing, ASME y14.5-2009|year=2009|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|location=NY|isbn=0-7918-3192-2|authorlink=ASME}}&lt;/ref&gt;  standard, the purpose of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) is to describe the engineering intent of parts and assemblies. The datum reference frame can describe how the part fits or functions. GD&amp;T can more accurately define the dimensional requirements for a part, allowing over 50% more tolerance zone than coordinate (or linear) dimensioning in some cases. Proper application of GD&amp;T will ensure that the part defined on the drawing has the desired form, fit (within limits) and function with the largest possible tolerances. GD&amp;T can add quality and reduce cost at the same time through producibility.

There are some fundamental rules that need to be applied (these can be found on page 7 of the 2009 edition of the standard):
*All dimensions must have a tolerance.  Every feature on every manufactured part is subject to variation, therefore, the limits of allowable variation must be specified. Plus and minus tolerances may be applied directly to dimensions or applied from a general tolerance block or general note.  For basic dimensions, geometric tolerances are indirectly applied in a related Feature Control Frame.  The only exceptions are for dimensions marked as minimum, maximum, stock or reference.
*Dimensions define the nominal geometry and allowable variation. Measurement and scaling of the drawing is not allowed except in certain cases.
*Engineering drawings define the requirements of finished (complete) parts. Every dimension and tolerance required to define the finished part shall be shown on the drawing. If additional dimensions would be helpful, but are not required, they may be marked as reference.
*Dimensions should be applied to features and arranged in such a way as to represent the function of the features. Additionally, dimensions should not be subject to more than one interpretation.
*Descriptions of manufacturing methods should be avoided. The geometry should be described without explicitly defining the method of manufacture.
*If certain sizes are required during manufacturing but are not required in the final geometry (due to shrinkage or other causes) they should be marked as non-mandatory.
*All dimensioning and tolerancing should be arranged for maximum readability and should be applied to visible lines in true profiles.
*When geometry is normally controlled by gage sizes or by code (e.g. stock materials), the dimension(s) shall be included with the gage or code number in parentheses following or below the dimension.
*Angles of 90° are assumed when lines (including center lines) are shown at right angles, but no angular dimension is explicitly shown.  (This also applies to other orthogonal angles of 0°, 180°, 270°, etc.)
*Dimensions and tolerances are valid at 20&amp;nbsp;°C / 101.3 kPa unless stated otherwise.
*Unless explicitly stated, all dimensions and tolerances are only valid when the item is in a free state.
*Dimensions and tolerances apply to the length, width, and depth of a feature including form variation.
*Dimensions and tolerances only apply at the level of the drawing where they are specified. It is not mandatory that they apply at other drawing levels, unless the specifications are repeated on the higher level drawing(s).

(Note: The rules above are not the exact rules stated in the ASME Y14.5-2009 standard.)

== Symbols ==&lt;!-- [[Engineering drawing abbreviations and symbols]] links here --&gt;
Tolerances: Type of tolerances used with symbols in feature control frames can be 1) equal bilateral 2) unequal bilateral 3) unilateral 4) no particular distribution (a &quot;floating&quot; zone)

Tolerances for the profile symbols are equal bilateral unless otherwise specified, and for the position symbol tolerances are always equal bilateral. For example, the position of a hole has a tolerance of .020 inches. This means the hole can move +/- .010 inches, which is an equal bilateral tolerance. It does not mean the hole can move +.015/-.005 inches, which is an unequal bilateral tolerance. Unequal bilateral and unilateral tolerances for profile are specified by adding further information to clearly show this is what is required.

=== Datums and datum references ===
{{further|Datum reference}}

A '''datum''' is a virtual ideal plane, line, point, or axis. A '''datum feature''' is a physical feature of a part identified by a '''datum feature symbol''' and corresponding '''datum feature triangle''', e.g.,

:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle\Box}\!\!\!\!{\scriptstyle\mathsf{A}}\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\blacktriangleleft\!\!\!|&lt;/math&gt;

These are then referred to by one or more or many 'datum references' which indicate measurements that should be made with respect to the corresponding datum feature .

==Data exchange ==
Exchange of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) information between [[CAD]] systems is available on different levels of fidelity for different purposes:
* In the early days of CAD, exchange-only lines, texts and symbols were written into the exchange file. A receiving system could display them on the screen or print them out, but only a human could interpret them.
* ''GD&amp;T presentation'': On a next higher level the presentation information is enhanced by grouping them together into ''callouts'' for a particular purpose, e.g. a ''datum feature callout'' and a ''datum reference frame''.  And there is also the information which of the curves in the file are leader, projection or dimension curves and which are used to form the shape of a product.
* ''GD&amp;T representation'': Unlike GD&amp;T presentation, the GD&amp;T representation does not deal with how the information is presented to the user but only deals with which element of a shape of a product has which GD&amp;T characteristic. A system supporting GD&amp;T representation may display the GD&amp;T information in some tree and other dialogs and allow the user to directly select and highlight the corresponding feature on the shape of the product, 2D and 3D.
* Ideally both GD&amp;T presentation and representation are available in the exchange file and are associated with each other.  Then a receiving system can allow a user to select a GD&amp;T callout and get the corresponding feature highlighted on the shape of the product.
* An enhancement of GD&amp;T representation is defining a formal language for GD&amp;T (similar to a programming language) which also has built-in rules and restrictions for the proper GD&amp;T usage. This is still a research area (see below reference to McCaleb and ISO 10303-1666).
* ''GD&amp;T validation'': Based on GD&amp;T representation data (but not on GD&amp;T presentation) and the shape of a product in some useful format (e.g. a [[boundary representation]]), it is possible to validate the completeness and consistency of the GD&amp;T information. The software tool FBTol from the [[Kansas City Plant]] is probably the first one in this area.
* GD&amp;T representation information can also be used for the software assisted manufacturing planning and cost calculation of parts. See ISO 10303-224 and 238 below.

[[File:Maßstabsleiste.png|thumb|A linear scale showing that 1cm on the map corresponds to 6km]]
A '''linear scale''', also called a '''bar scale''', '''scale bar''', '''graphic scale''', or '''graphical scale''', is a means of visually showing the [[Scale (map)|scale]] of a [[map]], [[nautical chart]], [[engineering drawing]], or [[architectural drawing]].

On large scale maps and charts, those covering a small area, and engineering and architectural drawings, the linear scale can be very simple, a line marked at intervals to show the distance on the earth or object which the distance on the scale represents. A person using the map can use a pair of dividers (or, less precisely, two fingers) to measure a distance by comparing it to the linear scale. The length of the line on the linear scale is equal to the distance represented on the earth multiplied by the map or chart's scale.

In most [[Map projection|projections]], scale varies with [[latitude]], so on small scale maps, covering large areas and a wide range of latitudes, the linear scale must show the scale for the range of latitudes covered by the map. One of these is shown below.

Since most nautical charts are constructed using the [[Mercator projection]] whose scale varies substantially with latitude, linear scales are not used on charts with scales smaller than approximately 1/80,000.&lt;ref name=bowditch02c3/&gt;&lt;ref name=dutton/&gt; Mariners generally use the [[nautical mile]], which, because a nautical mile is approximately equal to a minute of latitude, can be measured against the latitude scale at the sides of the chart.

While linear scales are used on architectural and engineering drawings, particularly those that are drawn after the subject has been built, many such drawings do not have a linear scale and are marked &quot;Do Not Scale Drawing&quot; in recognition of the fact that paper size changes with environmental changes and only dimensions that are specifically shown on the drawing can be used reliably in precise manufacturing.&lt;ref name=dnsd/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
The terms &quot;bar scale&quot;, &quot;graphic scale&quot;, &quot;graphical scale&quot;, &quot;linear scale&quot;, and &quot;scale&quot; are all used. ''[[Bowditch's American Practical Navigator|Bowditch]]'' defined only &quot;bar scale&quot; in its 1962 Glossary,&lt;ref name=bowditch62/&gt; but added a reference to &quot;graphic scale&quot; by its 2002 edition.&lt;ref name=bowditch02/&gt; Dutton used both terms in 1978.&lt;ref name=dutton/&gt; The [[International Hydrographic Organization]]'s ''Chart No. 1'' uses only &quot;linear scale&quot;.&lt;ref name=iho/&gt; The [[British Admiralty|British Admiralty's]] ''Mariner's Handbook'' uses &quot;scale&quot; to describe a linear scale and avoids confusion by using &quot;natural scale&quot; for the fraction defined at [[scale (map)]].&lt;ref name=mh/&gt;

The '''protractor head''' (two scales and protractor mechanism) is able to move freely across the surface of the [[drawing board]], sliding on two guides directly or indirectly anchored to the drawing board. These guides, which act separately, ensure the movement of the set in the horizontal or vertical direction of the [[drawing board]], and can be locked independently of each other.

[[File:L-Zeichnen.png | left | thumb | Drawing board with a [[parallel rule]], a precursor to drafting machines.]]
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Sesto San Giovanni, 1963) - BEIC 6346938.jpg|thumb|Ercole Marelli offices, Sesto San Giovanni. Photo by [[Paolo Monti]], 1963.]] 

The drafting machine was invented by Charles H. Little in 1901 (U.S. Patent No. 1,081,758),  and he founded the Universal Drafting Machine Company in Cleveland, Ohio, to manufacture and sell the instrument. &lt;ref&gt;The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, vol.36 (1950), p.341.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drafting machines were present in the design offices of European companies since the 1920s. It is curious to see how the Encyclopædia Britannica explicitly specifies 1930 as the year this tool was introduced, but an advertisement of &quot;Memorie di architettura pratica&quot; from 1913 places it twenty years before this date&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; at least in Italy.

In the older design sets, the movement of the protractor head was assured by a [[pantograph]] system that could keep the head in the same [[angle|angular]] position throughout its range of motion. The arms were balanced by a system of counterweights or [[spring (device)|springs]].

Typically, the machine is mounted on a [[drawing board]] with a hard and smooth surface, anchored to a base that allows its [[Wiktionary:tilt|tilting]] and lifting. Thus, the realization of a [[drawing]] can be achieved in the most convenient way on a working surface that can be tilted at any angle from horizontal to vertical.

There are special versions for [[ISO 216|A0]] double-sized boards, to make large drawings, or copying-boards with background illumination, which have all that is necessary to provide specific support.

With the drafting machine one can perform a series of drawing operations that otherwise could only be achieved with a much more complex use of the classic [[ruler]] [[Combination square|square]] and [[protractor]], as, for example, drawing [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines,  [[orthogonal]] lines, inclined lines according to a preset angle, measurement of [[angle]]s, etc.

With the development of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), the use of drafting machines, especially in the professional sector, has drastically declined, supplanted first by [[plotter|pen plotters]], and then by large-format [[inkjet printing|inkjet printer]]s.

==Description==
In his autobiography, published in 1904, polymath [[Herbert Spencer]] eloquently describes his own near re-invention of Nicholson's cyclograph while working as a [[civil engineer]] for the [[Birmingham and Gloucester Railway]].
  {{quote
  |text=During the latter part of 1839 the preparations of plans for crossings and sidings at various stations was put into my hands. A device for saving trouble was one of the consequences. Curves of very large radius had to be drawn; and, finding a [[beam-compass]] of adequate length difficult to manage, I bethought me of an instrumental application of the geometrical truth that angles in the same segment of a circle are equal to one another. An obvious implication is that if an angle be made rigid, and its arms be obliged to move through the two points terminating the segment, the apex of the angle must describe a circle. In pursuance of this idea I had made an instrument hinged like a foot-rule, but capable of having its hinge screwed tight in any position, and carrying a pen or pencil. Two needles thrust into the paper at the desired points, being pressed against by the arms of the instrument, as it was moved from side to side, its pen or pencil described the arc of a circle. When about to publish a description of this appliance, I discovered that it had been already devised, and was known as Nicholson’s Cyclograph.

[[Image:Peones.gif|frame|An example of a rendered [[animation]]]]
'''Rendering''' in [[visual art]] and [[technical drawing]] means the process of formulating,  adding [[color]], [[shading]], and [[texture (visual arts)|texturing]] of an image. It can also be used to describe the quality of execution of that process. When used as a means of expression, it is synonymous with [[illustrating]]. However, it may be used for mere [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] of existing [[data]] regardless of any preconceived message or idea to express. Rendering is also a technique that can be used while designing packaging and branding. 

The alternative method to rendering an image is capturing an image such as [[photography]] or [[image scanning]]. Both rendered and captured images can be [[Mixed_media|mixed]], [[image editing|edited]], or both.

==Rendering style==
'''Artistic rendering''' is the application of [[style (visual arts)|visual art style]]s to rendering. For [[photorealistic]] rendering styles, the emphasis is on accurate reproduction of light-and-shadow and the surface properties of the depicted objects, [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], or other more generic qualities. When the emphasis is on unique interpretive rendering styles, visual information is interpreted by the artist and displayed accordingly using the chosen [[art medium]] and level of [[abstraction]] in [[abstract art]].  In [[computer graphics]], interpretive rendering  styles are known as [[non-photorealistic rendering]] styles, but may be used to simplify [[technical illustration]]s. Rendering styles that combine photorealism with non-photorealism are known as [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealistic]] rendering styles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5111">{{About||the bowling term|Lofting (bowling)|the creator of Doctor Dolittle|Hugh Lofting}}
'''Lofting''' is a [[Technical drawing|drafting]] technique (sometimes using mathematical tables) whereby curved lines are generated, to be used in plans for streamlined objects such as aircraft and boats. The lines may be drawn on wood and the wood then cut for advanced [[woodworking]]. The technique can be as simple as bending a flexible object, such as a long strip of thin wood or thin plastic, so that it passes over three non-linear points and [[scribing]] the resultant curved line, or plotting the line using [[computers]] or [[mathematical tables]].

Lofting is particularly useful in [[boat building]], when it is used to draw and cut pieces for [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s and [[keel]]s, which are usually curved, often in three [[dimension]]s. Loftsmen at the mould lofts of [[shipyard]]s were responsible for taking the dimensions, and details from drawings and plans and translating this information into templates, battens, ordinates, cutting sketches, profiles, margins and other data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leithshipyards.com/mould-loft/lofting.html The Mould Loft]&lt;/ref&gt;Since the early 1970s [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) became normal for the shipbuilding design and lofting process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leithshipyards.com/mould-loft/computer-aided-design.html# CAD-Computer Aided Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lofting was also commonly used in aircraft design before the widespread adoption of computer-generated shaping programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aircraftdesign.com/shortcrs2.html Aircraft Design Short Courses (website), ''Aircraft Design: Configuration Layout &amp; Loft'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melmoth2.com/texts/Lofting.htm] Melmoth 2 (website), ''Lofting'' (by [[Peter Garrison]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic lofting==
[[File:Cecil Beaton Photographs- Tyneside Shipyards, 1943 DB23.jpg|thumb|left|Two men cutting templates in the mould loft, Tyneside Shipyards, 1943.]]

As ship design evolved from craft to science, designers learned various ways to produce long curves on a flat surface. Generating and drawing such curves became a part of ship lofting; &quot;lofting&quot; means drawing full-sized patterns, so called because it was often done in large, lightly constructed mezzanines or lofts above the factory floor. When aircraft design progressed beyond the stick-and-fabric boxes of its first decade of existence, the practice of lofting moved naturally into the aeronautical realm. As the storm clouds of [[World War II]] gathered in Europe, a US aircraft company, [[North American Aviation]], took the practice into the purely mathematical realm. One of that war's outstanding warplanes, the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], was designed using mathematical charts and tables rather than lofting tables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melmoth2.com/texts/Lofting.htm Melmoth 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lofting is the transfer of a ''Lines Plan'' to a ''Full Sized Plan''. This helps to assure that the boat will be accurate in its layout and pleasing in appearance. There are many methods to loft a set of plans.

Generally, boat building books have a detailed description of the lofting process, beyond the scope of this article. Plans can be lofted on a level wooden floor, marking heavy paper such as Red Rosin for the full-sized plans or directly on plywood sheets.

[[File:Cecil Beaton Photographs- Tyneside Shipyards, 1943 DB88.jpg|thumb|Two men lifting templates in the mould loft, Tyneside Shipyards, 1943.]]

The first step is to lay out the grid, mark the Base Line along the length of the paper or plywood sheet. Then nail [[Battens]] every 12&amp;nbsp;inches (or more in some cases) where the station lines are to be set as a mark for the perpendicular line, which is marked with a T-square. The previous steps are followed in turn by marking the Top Line and the Water Line. Before continuing make sure to check the lines by using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and make sure the grid is square.

The second step is to mark the points from the table of offsets. All measurements off the table of offsets are listed in Millimeters or the  Feet, Inches and Eighths. The points are plotted at each station then use a small nail and a batten to Fair (draw with a fair curve) the boat's lines.

An '''architectural drawing''' or '''architect's drawing''' is a [[technical drawing]] of a building (or building project) that falls within the definition of [[architecture]]. Architectural drawings are used by [[architect]]s and others for a number of purposes: to develop a design idea into a coherent proposal, to communicate ideas and concepts, to convince clients of the merits of a design, to enable a [[building contractor]] to construct it, as a record of the completed work, and to make a record of a building that already exists.

Architectural drawings are made according to a set of [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], which include particular views (floor plan, section etc.), sheet sizes, units of measurement and scales, annotation and cross referencing. Conventionally, drawings were made in ink on paper or a similar material, and any copies required had to be laboriously made by hand. The twentieth century saw a shift to drawing on tracing paper, so that mechanical copies could be run off efficiently.

The development of the [[computer]] had a major impact on the methods used to design and create technical drawings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bert02&quot;&gt;Gary R. Bertoline et al. (2002) ''Technical Graphics Communication''. p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; making manual drawing almost obsolete, and opening up new possibilities of form using organic shapes and complex geometry. Today the vast majority of drawings are created using [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-cad-drawings.htm Wisegeek, basic definition of the scope of CAD drawings.]

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size and scale==
{{main|Paper size|Engineer's scale|Architect's scale|Metric scale}}
The size of drawings reflects the materials available and the size that is convenient to transport – rolled up or folded, laid out on a table, or pinned up on a wall. The draughting process may impose limitations on the size that is realistically workable. Sizes are determined by a consistent [[paper size]] system, according to local usage. Normally the largest [[paper size]] used in modern architectural practice is ISO A0 ({{convert|841|×|1189|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) or in the USA Arch E ({{convert|762|×|1067|mm|in|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) or Large E size ({{convert|915|×|1220|mm|in|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name=Dummies&gt;David Byrnes, AutoCAD 2008 For Dummies. Publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons; illustrated edition (4 May 2007). ISBN 0-470-11650-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural drawings are drawn to scale, so that relative sizes are correctly represented. The scale is chosen both to ensure the whole building will fit on the chosen sheet size, and to show the required amount of detail. At the scale of one eighth of an inch to one foot (1:96) or the metric equivalent 1 to 100, walls are typically shown as simple outlines corresponding to the overall thickness. At a larger scale, half an inch to one foot (1:24) or the nearest common metric equivalent 1 to 20, the layers of different materials that make up the wall construction are shown. Construction details are drawn to a larger scale, in some cases full size (1 to 1 scale).

Scale drawings enable dimensions to be &quot;read&quot; off the drawing, i.e. measured directly. [[Imperial units|Imperial]] scales (feet and inches) are equally readable using an ordinary ruler. On a one-eighth inch to one foot scale drawing, the one-eighth divisions on the ruler can be read off as feet. Architects normally use a [[scale ruler]] with different scales marked on each edge. A third method, used by builders in estimating, is to measure directly off the drawing and multiply by the scale factor.

Dimensions can be measured off drawings made on a stable medium such as vellum. All processes of reproduction introduce small errors, especially now that different copying methods mean that the same drawing may be re-copied, or copies made in several different ways. Consequently, dimensions need to be written (&quot;figured&quot;) on the drawing. The disclaimer &quot;Do not scale off dimensions&quot; is commonly inscribed on architects drawings, to guard against errors arising in the copying process.

==Standard views used in architectural drawing==
''This section deals with the conventional views used to represent a building or structure. See the [[#Types of architectural drawing|Types of architectural drawing]] section below for drawings classified according to their purpose.''

[[File:Queen's House plan.jpg|thumb|right|Principal floor plans of the [[Queen's House]], Greenwich (UK).]]

===Floor plan===
A [[floor plan]] is the most fundamental architectural [[diagram]], a view from above showing the arrangement of spaces in building in the same way as a [[map]], but showing the arrangement at a particular level of a building. Technically it is a horizontal section cut through a building (conventionally at four feet / one metre and twenty centimetres above floor level), showing walls, windows and door openings and other features at that level. The plan view includes anything that could be seen below that level: the floor, stairs (but only up to the plan level), fittings and sometimes furniture. Objects above the plan level (e.g. beams overhead) can be indicated as dotted lines.

Geometrically, [[plan view]] is defined as a vertical [[orthographic projection]] of an object on to a horizontal plane, with the horizontal plane cutting through the building.

[[File:400 N LSD site plan.jpg|thumb|right|Site plan of the proposed [[Chicago Spire]] by [[Santiago Calatrava]].]]

===Site plan===
A [[site plan]] is a specific type of plan, showing the whole context of a building or group of buildings. A site plan shows property boundaries and means of access to the site, and nearby structures if they are relevant to the design. For a [[Real estate development|development]] on an urban site, the site plan may need to show adjoining streets to demonstrate how the design fits into the urban fabric. Within the site boundary, the site plan gives an overview of the entire scope of work. It shows the buildings (if any) already existing and those that are proposed, usually as a building footprint; roads, parking lots, footpaths, [[hardscape|hard landscaping]], trees and planting. For a construction project, the site plan also needs to show all the services connections: drainage and sewer lines, water supply, electrical and communications cables, exterior lighting etc.

Site plans are commonly used to [[Representation (arts)|represent]] a building proposal prior to detailed design: drawing up a site plan is a tool for deciding both the site layout and the size and orientation of proposed new buildings. A site plan is used to verify that a proposal complies with local development codes, including restrictions on historical sites. In this context the site plan forms part of a legal agreement, and there may be a requirement for it to be drawn up by a licensed professional: architect, engineer, landscape architect or land surveyor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ottawa.ca/en/homeowners-guide-small-projects-1/how-detailed-should-your-plans-be City of Ottawa, specific requirements for drawings to be submitted for a building permit]. Local authorities worldwide publish similar information.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panthéon Soufflot - élevation principale.png| thumb|right|Elevation of the principal façade of the [[Panthéon, Paris]]]]

===Elevation===
An elevation is a view of a building seen from one side, a flat representation of one [[façade]]. This is the most common view used to describe the external appearance of a building. Each elevation is labelled in relation to the compass direction it faces, e.g. looking toward the north you would be seeing the southern elevation of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Frank| last = Ching| author-link = | title = Architectural Graphics - Second Edition | place = New York | publisher = Van Norstrand Reinhold | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-442-21862-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings are rarely a simple rectangular shape in plan, so a typical elevation may show all the parts of the building that are seen from a particular direction.

Geometrically, an elevation is a horizontal orthographic projection of a building on to a vertical plane, the vertical plane normally being parallel to one side of the building.

Architects also use the word elevation as a [[synonym]] for [[façade]], so the north elevation is literally the north-facing wall of the building.

[[File:L-Observatorium.png|thumb|Section drawing of the [[Astrophysical Institute Potsdam|Observatorium]] at Potsdam.]]

===Cross section===
A [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]], also simply called a section, represents a vertical plane cut through the object, in the same way as a [[floor plan]] is a horizontal section viewed from the top. In the section view, everything cut by the section plane is shown as a bold line, often with a solid fill to show objects that are cut through, and anything seen beyond generally shown in a thinner line. Sections are used to describe the relationship between different levels of a building. In the Observatorium drawing illustrated here, the section shows the dome which can be seen from the outside, a second dome that can only be seen inside the building, and the way the space between the two accommodates a large astronomical telescope: relationships that would be difficult to understand from plans alone.

A sectional elevation is a combination of a cross section, with elevations of other parts of the building seen beyond the section plane.

Geometrically, a cross section is a horizontal orthographic projection of a building on to a vertical plane, with the vertical plane cutting through the building.

===Isometric and axonometric projections===
Isometric and axonometric projections are a simple way of representing a three dimensional object, keeping the elements to scale and showing the relationship between several sides of the same object, so that the complexities of a shape can be clearly understood.

There is some confusion about the terms isometric and axonometric. “Axonometric is a word that has been used by architects for hundreds of years. Engineers use the word axonometric as a generic term to include isometric, diametric and trimetric drawings.”&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;Alan Piper, ''Drawing for Designers''. Laurence King Publishing 2007. ISBN 978-1-85669-533-6 Page 57, definition of axonometric drawing&lt;/ref&gt; This article uses the terms in the architecture-specific sense.

Despite fairly complex geometrical explanations, for the purposes of practical draughting the difference between isometric and axonometric is simple (see diagram above). In both, the plan is drawn on a skewed or rotated grid, and the verticals are projected vertically on the page. All lines are drawn to scale so that relationships between elements are accurate. In many cases a different scale is required for different [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]], and again this can be calculated but in practice was often simply estimated by eye.
* An [[Isometric projection|isometric]] uses a plan grid at 30 degrees from the horizontal in both directions, which distorts the plan shape. Isometric graph paper can be used to construct this kind of drawing. This view is useful to explain construction details (e.g. three dimensional joints in joinery). The isometric was the standard view until the mid twentieth century, remaining popular until the 1970s, especially for textbook diagrams and illustrations.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;W. B. McKay: McKay's Building Construction. Donhead Publishing 2005. ISBN 978-1-873394-72-4 A new reprint of the combined three volumes that McKay published between 1938 and 1944. Heavily illustrated textbook of architectural detailing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donhead.com/Look%20Inside/Mckay2.pdf Sample pages of isometric drawings from McKay's Building Construction]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cabinet projection]] is similar, but only one axis is skewed, the others being horizontal and vertical. Originally used in cabinet making, the advantage is that a principal side (e.g. a cabinet front) is displayed without distortion, so only the less important sides are skewed. The lines leading away from the eye are drawn at a reduced scale to lessen the degree of distortion. The cabinet projection is seen in Victorian engraved advertisements and architectural textbooks,&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt; but has virtually disappeared from general use.
* An [[Axonometric projection|axonometric]] uses a 45 degree plan grid, which keeps the original orthogonal geometry of the plan. The great advantage of this view for architecture is that the draughtsman can work directly from a plan, without having to reconstruct it on a skewed grid. In theory the plan should be set at 45 degrees, but this introduces confusing coincidences where opposite corners align. Unwanted effects can be avoided by rotating the plan while still projecting vertically. This is sometimes called a planometric or plan oblique view,&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; and allows freedom to choose any suitable angle to present the most useful view of an object.

Traditional draughting techniques used 30-60 and 45 degree [[set square]]s, and that determined the angles used in these views. Once the adjustable square became common those limitations were lifted.

The axonometric gained in popularity in the twentieth century, not just as a convenient diagram but as a formal presentation technique, adopted in particular by the [[Modern Movement]].&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt; Axonometric drawings feature prominently in the influential 1970's drawings of [[Michael Graves]], [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and others, using not only straightforward views but worms-eye view, unusually and exaggerated rotations of the plan, and exploded elements.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W Schaller, Architecture in Watercolour. Van Nostrand Re9inhold, New York 1990. ISBN 0-442-23484-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The axonometric view is not readily generated by CAD programmes which create views from a three dimensional model. Consequently, it is now rarely used.

===Detail drawings===
Detail drawings show a small part of the construction at a larger scale, to show how the component parts fit together. They are also used to show small surface details, for example decorative elements. Section drawings at large scale are a standard way of showing building construction details, typically showing complex junctions (such as floor to wall junction, window openings, eaves and roof apex) that cannot be clearly shown on a drawing that includes the full height of the building. A full set of construction details needs to show plan details as well as vertical section details. One detail is seldom produced in isolation: a set of details shows the information needed to understand the construction in three dimensions. Typical scales for details are 1/10, 1/5 and full size.

In traditional construction, many details were so fully standardised, that few detail drawings were required to construct a building. For example, the construction of a [[sash window]] would be left to the carpenter, who would fully understand what was required, but unique decorative details of the facade would be drawn up in detail. In contrast, modern buildings need to be fully detailed because of the proliferation of different products, methods and possible solutions.

==Architectural perspective==
[[File:Dercy House drawing-room1777.jpg|thumb|right|Two point perspective, interior of Dercy House by [[Robert Adam]], 1777.]]
[[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] in drawing is an approximate representation on a flat surface of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The key concepts here are:
* Perspective is the view from a particular fixed viewpoint.
* Horizontal and vertical edges in the object are represented by horizontals and verticals in the drawing.
* Lines leading away into the distance appear to converge at a [[vanishing point]].
* All horizontals converge to a point on the [[horizon]], which is a horizontal line at eye level.
* Verticals converge to a point either above or below the horizon.

The basic categorization of artificial perspective is by the number of vanishing points:
* [[One-point perspective]] where objects facing the viewer are orthogonal, and receding lines converge to a single vanishing point.
* [[Two-point perspective]] reduces distortion by viewing objects at an angle, with all the horizontal lines receding to one of two vanishing points, both located on the horizon.
* [[Three-point perspective]] introduces additional realism by making the verticals recede to a third vanishing point, which is above or below depending upon whether the view is seen from above or below.

The normal convention in architectural perspective is to use two-point perspective, with all the verticals drawn as verticals on the page.

Three-point perspective gives a casual, photographic snapshot effect. In professional [[architectural photography]], conversely, a [[view camera]] or a [[perspective control lens]] is used to eliminate the third vanishing point, so that all the verticals are vertical on the photograph, as with the perspective convention. This can also be done by digital manipulation of a photograph taken with a standard lens.

[[Aerial perspective]] is a technique in painting, for indicating distance by approximating the effect of the atmosphere on distant objects. In daylight, as an ordinary object gets further from the eye, its contrast with the background is reduced, its colour saturation is reduced, and its colour becomes more blue. Not to be confused with [[aerial view]] or bird's eye view, which is the view as seen (or imagined) from a high vantage point. In J M Gandy's perspective of the Bank of England (see illustration at the beginning of this article), Gandy portrayed the building as a picturesque ruin in order to show the internal plan arrangement, a precursor of the cutaway view.&lt;ref name=Stamp&gt;The Great Perspectivists, by Gavin Stamp. RIBA Drawings Series, published by Trefoil Books London 1982. ISBN 0-86294-002-8&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[wikt:montage|montage]] image is produced by superimposing a perspective image of a building on to a photographic background. Care is needed to record the position from which the photograph was taken, and to generate the perspective using the same viewpoint. This technique is popular in computer visualisation, where the building can be [[photorealism|photorealistically]] rendered, and the final image is intended to be almost indistinguishable from a photograph.

==Sketches and diagrams==
[[File:Y-blokken som plassvegg.jpg|thumb|right|Architect's early concept sketches.]]
A [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]] is a rapidly executed freehand drawing, a quick way to record and develop an idea, not intended as a finished work. A [[diagram]] may also be drawn freehand but deals with symbols, to develop the logic of a design. Both may be worked up into a more presentable form and used to communicate the principles of a design.

In architecture, the finished work is expensive and time consuming, so it is important to resolve the design as fully as possible before construction work begins. Complex modern buildings involve a large team of different specialist disciplines, and communication at the early design stages is essential to keep the design moving towards a coordinated outcome.&lt;ref name=&quot;BoCo04&quot;&gt;Richard Boland and Fred Collopy (2004). ''Managing as designing''. p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects (and other designers) start investigating a new design with sketches and diagrams, to develop a rough design that provides an adequate response to the particular design problems.

There are two basic elements to a building design, the aesthetic and the practical. The aesthetic element includes the layout and visual appearance, the anticipated feel of the materials, and cultural references that will influence the way people perceive the building. Practical concerns include space allocated for different activities, how people enter and move around the building, daylight and artificial lighting, acoustics, traffic noise, legal matters and building codes, and many other issues. While both aspects are partly a matter of customary practice, every site is different. Many architects actively seek innovation, thereby increasing the number of problems to be resolved.

Architectural [[legend]] often refers to designs made on the back of an envelope/napkin/cigarette packet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/mar/08/architecture-exhibition|Le Corbusier's sketch design for his Cabanon&lt;/ref&gt; Initial thoughts are important, even if they have to be discarded along the way, because they provide the central idea around which the design can develop.&lt;ref name=Yee&gt;Rendow Yee (2002). ''Architectural Drawing: A Visual Compendium of Types and Methods''. 2nd Edition. Wiley, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a sketch is inaccurate, it is disposable and allows for freedom of thought, for trying different ideas quickly. Choice becomes sharply reduced once the design is committed to a scale drawing, and the sketch stage is almost always essential.

Diagrams are mainly used to resolve practical matters. In the early phases of the design architects use diagrams to develop, explore, and communicate ideas and solutions. They are essential tools for thinking, problem solving, and communication in the design disciplines. Diagrams can be used to resolve spatial relationships, but they can also represent forces and flows, e.g. the forces of sun and wind, or the flows of people and materials through a building.&lt;ref name=&quot;YiGr01&quot;&gt;Ellen Yi-Luen Do†&amp; Mark D. Gross (2001). [http://depts.washington.edu/redline1/AIRE264.pdf &quot;Thinking with diagrams in architectural design&quot;]. In: ''Artificial Intelligence Review'' 15: 135-149, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Exploded view drawing|exploded view]] diagram shows component parts dis-assembled in some way, so that each can be seen on its own. These views are common in technical manuals, but are also used in architecture, either in conceptual diagrams or to illustrate technical details. In a [[Cutaway (3D graphics)|cutaway view]] parts of the exterior are omitted to show the interior, or details of internal construction.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas C. Papadakis (1988). ''Deconstruction in Architecture: In Architecture and Urbanism''. p.65.&lt;/ref&gt; Although common in technical illustration, including many building products and systems, the cutaway is in fact little-used in architectural drawing.

==Types of architectural drawing==
Architectural drawings are produced for a specific purpose, and can be classified accordingly. Several elements are often included on the same sheet, for example a sheet showing a plan together with the principal façade.

===Presentation drawings===
Drawings intended to explain a scheme and to promote its merits. Working drawings may include tones or [[hatching|hatches]] to emphasise different materials, but they are diagrams, not intended to appear realistic. Basic presentation drawings typically include people, vehicles and trees, taken from a library of such images, and are otherwise very similar in style to working drawings. [[Artistic rendering|Rendering]] is the art of adding surface textures and shadows to show the visual qualities of a building more realistically. An [[architectural illustrator]] or [[graphic designer]] may be employed to prepare specialist presentation images, usually perspectives or highly finished site plans, floor plans and elevations etc.

===Survey drawings===
Measured drawings of existing land, structures and buildings. Architects need an accurate set of survey drawings as a basis for their working drawings, to establish exact dimensions for the construction work. Surveys are usually measured and drawn up by specialist [[Surveying|land surveyors]].

===Record drawings===
Historically, architects have made record drawings in order to understand and emulate the great architecture known to them. In the Renaissance, architects from all over Europe studied and recorded the remains of the Roman and Greek civilizations, and used these influences to develop the architecture of the period. Records are made both individually, for local purposes, and on a large scale for publication. Historic surveys worth referring to include:
* [[Colen Campbell]]'s ''Vitruvius Brittanicus'', illustrations of English buildings by [[Inigo Jones]] and [[Sir Christopher Wren]], as well as Campbell himself and other prominent architects of the era.
* The [[Survey of London]], founded in 1894 by [[Charles Robert Ashbee]] and now available through [[English Heritage]]. A record of notable streets and individual buildings in the former County of London.
* [[Historic American Buildings Survey]], records of notable buildings drawn up during the 1930s [[Great Depression|Depression]], this collection is held by the Library of Congress and is available copyright-free on the internet.

Record drawings are also used in construction projects, where &quot;as-built&quot; drawings of the completed building take account of all the variations made during the course of construction.

===Working drawings===
A comprehensive set of drawings used in a building construction project: these will include not only architect's drawings but structural and services engineer's drawings etc. Working drawings logically subdivide into location, assembly and component drawings.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Arthur Thompson, Architectural Design Procedures, Second Edition. Architectural Press: Elsevier 2007. ISBN 978-0-340-71941-1&lt;/ref&gt;
* Location drawings, also called general arrangement drawings, include floor plans, sections and elevations: they show where the construction elements are located.
* Assembly drawings show how the different parts are put together. For example, a wall detail will show the layers that make up the construction, how they are fixed to structural elements, how to finish the edges of openings, and how prefabricated components are to be fitted.
* Component drawings enable self-contained elements e.g. windows and doorsets, to be fabricated in a workshop, and delivered to site complete and ready for installation. Larger components may include roof trusses, cladding panels, cupboards and kitchens. Complete rooms, especially hotel bedrooms and bathrooms, may be made as prefabricated pods complete with internal decorations and fittings.
Traditionally, working drawings would typically combine plans, sections, elevations and some details to provide a complete explanation of a building on one sheet. That was possible because little detail was included, the building techniques involved being common knowledge amongst building professionals. Modern working drawings are much more detailed and it is standard practice to isolate each view on a separate sheet. Notes included on drawings are brief, referring to standardised specification documents for more information. Understanding the layout and construction of a modern building involves studying an often-sizeable set of drawings and documents.

==Drafting==
[[File:Architect.png|thumb|right|Architect at his drawing board, 1893]]
Until the latter part of the twentieth century, all architectural drawings were manually produced, either by architects or by trained (but less skilled) [[draughtsman|draughtsmen]] (or [[drafter]]s), who did not generate the design, although they made many of the less important decisions. This system continues with CAD draughting: many design architects have little or no knowledge of CAD software programmes and rely upon others to take their designs beyond the sketch stage. Draughtsmen may specialize in a type of structure, such as residential or commercial, or in a type of construction: timber frame, reinforced concrete, prefabrication etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLC07&quot;&gt;[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]. [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos111.htm ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition: Drafters''] dated: 18 December 2007. accessed: 24 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional tools of the architect were the [[drawing board]] or draughting table, [[T-square]] and [[set square]]s, [[protractor]], [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]], [[pencil]] and [[technical pen|drawing pens]] of different types.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yee&quot;/&gt; Drawings were made on [[vellum]], coated [[linen]], and on [[tracing paper]]. [[Technical lettering|Lettering]] would either be done by hand, mechanically using a [[stencil]], or a combination of the two. Ink lines were drawn with a [[ruling pen]], a relatively sophisticated device similar to a dip-in pen but with adjustable line width, capable of producing a very fine controlled line width. Ink pens had to be dipped into ink frequently. Draughtsmen worked standing up, and kept the ink on a separate table to avoid spilling ink on the drawing.{{Citation needed|reason=article|date=July 2009}}

Twentieth century developments include the [[parallel motion]] drawing board, and more complicated improvements on the basic T-square. The development of reliable [[Technical pen|technical drawing pens]] allowed for faster draughting and stencilled lettering. [[Letraset]] dry transfer lettering and half-tone sheets were popular from the 1970s until computers made those processes obsolete.

===Computer-aided design===
[[File:Campus-SKOLKOVO.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Computer generated perspective of the Moscow School of Management, by David Adjaye]]

[[Computer-aided design]] is the use of computer software to create drawings. Today the vast majority of technical drawings of all kinds are made using CAD. Instead of drawing lines on paper, the computer records equivalent information electronically. There are many advantages to this system: repetition is reduced because complex elements can be copied, duplicated and stored for re-use. Errors can be deleted, and the speed of draughting allows many permutations to be tried before the design is finalised. On the other hand, CAD drawing encourages a proliferation of detail and increased expectations of accuracy, aspects which reduce the efficiency originally expected from the move to computerisation.

Professional CAD software such as [[AutoCAD]] is complex and requires both training and experience before the operator becomes fully productive. Consequently, skilled CAD operators are often divorced from the design process. Simpler software such as [[SketchUp]] and [[Vectorworks]] allows for more intuitive drawing and is intended as a design tool.

CAD is used to create all kinds of drawings, from working drawings to [[photorealistic]] perspective views. [[Architectural rendering]]s (also called visualisations) are made by creating a three-dimensional model using CAD. The model can be viewed from any direction to find the most useful viewpoints. Different software (for example [[Autodesk 3ds Max]]) is then used to apply colour and texture to surfaces, and to represent shadows and reflections. The result can be accurately combined with photographic elements: people, cars, background landscape.

[[Building information modeling]] (BIM) is the logical development of CAD drawing, a relatively new technology but fast becoming mainstream. The design team collaborates to create a three-dimensional computer model, and all plans and other two-dimensional views are generated directly from the model, ensuring spatial consistency. The key innovation here is to share the model via the internet, so that all the design functions (site survey, architecture, structure and services) can be integrated into a single model, or as a series of models associated with each specialism that are shared throughout the design development process. Some form of management, not necessarily by the architect, needs to be in place to resolve conflicting priorities. The starting point of BIM is spatial design, but it also enables components to be quantified and scheduled directly from the information embedded in the model.

An [[architectural animation]] is a short film showing how a proposed building will look: the moving image makes three-dimensional forms much easier to understand. An animation is generated from a series of hundreds or even thousands of still images, each made in the same way as an architectural visualisation. A computer-generated building is created using a CAD programme, and that is used to create more or less realistic views from a sequence of viewpoints. The simplest animations use a moving viewpoint, while more complex animations can include moving objects: people, vehicles and so on.

==Architectural reprographics==
{{Main|Architectural reprography}}
[[File:Architectural Drawing of &quot;The House of Tomorrow&quot;.JPG|thumb|right|Blueprint]]
Reprographics or reprography covers a variety of technologies, media, and support services used to make multiple copies of original drawings. Prints of architectural drawings are still sometimes called [[blueprint]]s, after one of the early processes which produced a white line on blue paper. The process was superseded by the dye-line print system which prints black on white coated paper ([[Whiteprint]]). The standard modern processes are the [[ink-jet printer]], [[laser printer]] and [[photocopier]], of which the ink-jet and laser printers are commonly used for large-format printing. Although colour printing is now commonplace, it remains expensive above A3 size, and architect's working drawings still tend to adhere to the black and white / greyscale aesthetic.

[[File:Building services coordinated drawing.JPG|thumb|right|400px|An excerpt from a coordinated working drawing at 1:50 scale]]
'''Mechanical systems drawing''' is a type of [[technical drawing]] that shows information about heating, ventilating, and air conditioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;MECH&quot;&gt;[http://www.about-building-in-canada.com/mechanical.html &quot;Building in Canada. The Requirements before Any Construction Project Begins&quot;], ''[[Building in Canada]]'', Retrieved on 2011-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a powerful tool that helps analyze complex systems. These drawings are often a set of detailed drawings used for construction projects; it is a requirement for all [[HVAC]] work. They are based on the floor and reflected ceiling plans of the architect. After the mechanical drawings are complete, they become part of the construction drawings, which is then used to apply for a building permit. They are also used to determine the price of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;MECH&quot; /&gt;

==Sets of drawings==
===United States===
====Arrangement drawing====
Arrangement drawings include information about the self-contained units that make up the system: table of parts, fabrication and detail drawing, overall dimension, weight/mass, lifting points, and information needed to construct, test, lift, transport, and install the equipment. These drawings should show at least three different [[orthographic projection (geometry)|orthographic]] views and clear details of all the components and how they are assembled.&lt;ref name=&quot;PROCESS&quot;&gt;[http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Drawing/Mech_Drawings.html &quot;Mechanical Drawing&quot;], ''[[Roymech]]'' 5 February 2011. Retrieved on 2011-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assembly drawing====
The assembly drawing typically includes three orthographic views of the system: overall dimensions, weight and mass, identification of all the components, quantities of material, supply details, list of reference drawings, and notes. Assembly drawings detail how certain component parts are assembled.&lt;ref name=&quot;PROCESS&quot; /&gt;

An assembly drawing shows which order the product is put together, showing all the parts as if they were stretched out. This will help a welder to understand how the product will go together so he get an idea of where the weld is needed.  The assembly drawing will contain the following; information overall dimensions, weight and mass, identification of all the components, quantities of material, supply details, list of reference drawings, and notes.

====Detail drawing====
In detail drawings, components used to build the mechanical system are described in some detail to show that the designer's specifications are met: relevant codes, standards, geometry, weight, mass, material, heat treatment requirements, surface texture, size tolerances, and geometric tolerances.&lt;ref name=&quot;PROCESS&quot; /&gt;

===Fabrication drawings===
A fabrication is made up of many different parts. A fabrication drawing has a list of parts that make up the fabrication. In the list, parts are identified (balloons and leader lines) and complex details are included: welding details, material standards, codes, and tolerances, and details about heat/stress treatments. and also&lt;ref name=&quot;PROCESS&quot; /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
====Tender drawings====

====Sketch drawing====
Line diagrams and layouts indicating basic proposals, location of main items of plant, routes of main pipes, air ducts and cable runs in such detail as to illustrate the incorporation of the engineering services within the project as a whole.

====Schematic drawing====
The schematic is a line diagram, not necessarily to scale, that describes interconnection of components in a system. The main features of a schematic drawing show:
*A two dimensional layout with divisions that show distribution of the system between building levels, or an isometric-style layout that shows distribution of systems across individual floor levels
*All functional components that make up the system, i.e., plant items, pumps, fans, valves, strainers, terminals, electrical switchgear, distribution and components
*Symbols and line conventions, in accordance with industry standard guidance
*Labels for pipe, duct, and cable sizes where not shown elsewhere
*Components that have a sensing and control function, and links between them—building management systems, fire alarms and HV controls
*Major components, so their whereabouts in specifications and other drawings can be easily determined

====Detailed design drawing====
A drawing  the intended locations of plant items and service routes in such detail as to indicate the design intent. The main features of detailed design drawings should be as follows:
*Plan layouts to a scale of at least 1:100.
*Plant areas to a scale of at least 1:50 and accompanied by cross-sections.
*The drawing don't indicate precise positions of services, but should be feasible to install the services within the general routes indicated. It should be possible to produce co-ordination drawings or installation drawings without major re-routing of the services.
*Represent pipework by single line layouts.
*Represent ductwork by either double or single line layouts as required to ensure that the routes indicated are feasible.
*Indicate on the drawing the space available for major service routing in both horizontal and vertical planes.

====Installation drawing====
A drawing which based on the detailed drawing, installation drawing or co-ordination drawing (interface drawing) with the primary purpose of defining that information needed by the tradesmen on site to install the works or concurrently work among various engineering assembly. The main features of typical installation drawings are:
*Plan layouts to a scale of at least 1:50, accompanied by cross-sections to a scale of at least 1:20 for all congested areas
*A spatially coordinated drawing, i.e., show no physical location clashes between the system components
*Allowance for inclusion of all supports and fixtures necessary to install the works
*Allowance for the service at its widest point for spaces between pipe and duct runs, for insulation, standard fitting dimensions, and joint widths
*Installation details provided from shop drawings
*Installation working space; space to facilitate commissioning and space to allow on-going operation and maintenance in accordance with the relevant health and safety requirements
*Plant and equipment including alternatives and options
*Dimensions where services positioning is important enough not to installers
*Plant room layouts to a scale of at least 1:20, accompanied by cross-sections and elevations to a scale of at least 1:20

====Record (as installed, as-built) drawing====
A drawing showing the building and services installations as installed at the date of practical completion. Generally the record drawing is a development of the installation drawing. The main features of the record drawings should be as follows.
*Provide a record of the locations of all the systems and components installed including pumps, fans, valves, strainers, terminals, electrical switchgear, distribution and components.
*Use a scale not less than that of the installation drawings.
*Have marked on the drawings the positions of access points for operating and maintenance purposes.
*The drawings should not be dimensioned unless the inclusion of a dimension is considered necessary for location.

====Builder's work Drawing====
=====Design stage=====
These drawings show the provisions required to accommodate the services that significantly affect the design of the building structure, fabric, and external works. This includes drawings (and schedules) of work the building trade carries out, or that must be cost-estimated at the design stage, e.g., plant bases

=====Installation stage=====
These drawings show requirements for building works necessary to facilitate installing the engineering services (other than where it is appropriate to mark out on site). Information on these drawing includes details of all:
*Bases for plant formed in concrete, brickwork or blockwork, to a scale of not less than 1:20
*Attendant builders work, holes, chases, etc. for conduits, cables and trunking etc. and any item where access for a function of the installation is required to a scale of not less than 1:100
*Purpose made brackets for supporting service or plant/equipment to a scale of not less than 1:50
*Accesses into ceilings, ducts, etc. at a scale of not less than 1:50
*Special fixings, inserts, brackets, anchors, suspensions, supports etc. at a scale of not less than 1:20
*Sleeves, puddle flanges, access chambers at a scale not less than 1:20

==Details to include==
* Size, type, and layout of ducting
* Diffusers, heat registers, return air grilles, dampers
* Turning vanes, ductwork insulation
* HVAC unit
* Thermostats
* Electrical, water, and/or gas connections

* Heating and/or cooling load summary
* Connection to existing systems
* Demolition of part or all of existing systems
* Smoke detector and firestat re-ducting
* Thermostat programming
* Heat loss and heat gain calculations
* Special condition&lt;ref name=&quot;MECH&quot; /&gt;

==Job outlook==
About 80,000 jobs are held by mechanical drafters in the United States of America during 2008. From 2008 to 2018, mechanical drafting hiring rate is expected to neither increase nor decrease. It is encouraged to either take two additional years of training in drafting school after high school or attend a four-year college/university to develop better technical skills and gain more experience with [[CAD]] (computer-aided design).&lt;ref name=&quot;JOBS&quot;&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos111.htm &quot;Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition&quot;], ''[[Drafters]]'', Retrieved on 2011-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income of mechanical drafters in 2008===
* Lowest 10% made $29,390.
* Highest 10% made $71,340.
* Middle 50% made between $36,490 to $59,010.
* Median: $46,640.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOBS&quot; /&gt;

==ADDA certification==
The American Design Drafting Association (ADDA) has developed a Drafter Certification Test. The test assesses the drafter's skill in basic drafting concepts: geometric construction, working drawings, and architectural terms and standards. The test is administered periodically at ADDA-authorized sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOBS&quot; /&gt;

==Regulations in Canada==
Mechanical system drawings must abide by all of the following regulations: the [[National Building Code of Canada]], the National Fire Code, and Model National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings. For residential projects, The National Housing Code of Canada and the Model National Energy Code of Canada for Houses must also be followed. These drawings must also adhere to local and provincial codes and bylaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;MECH&quot; /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Heliographic_copy.jpg|thumb|Whiteprint plan copy.]]
'''Whiteprint''' describes a document reproduction produced by using the [[diazo]] chemical process. It is also known as the '''blue-line process''' since the result is blue lines on a white background. It is a contact printing process which accurately reproduces the original in size, but cannot reproduce continuous tones or colors. The light-sensitivity of the chemicals used was known in the 1890s and several related printing processes were patented at that time. Whiteprinting replaced the [[blueprint]] process for reproducing architectural and [[engineering drawing]]s because the process was simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals. A blue-line print is not permanent and will fade if exposed to light for weeks or months, but  a drawing print that lasts only a few months is sufficient for many purposes.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642801/whiteprint Blueprints replaced by whiteprints]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The diazo printing process==
There are two components in this process:
# [[Diazonium compound|diazonium salt]]: a light sensitive chemical
# [[Azo dye]] (also known as the coupler): a colorless chemical that combines with the salt to produce color.

In a variety of combinations and strengths, these two chemicals are mixed together in water and coated onto [[paper]]. The resulting coating is then dried yielding the specially treated paper commercially sold as Diazo paper. This solution can also be applied to [[polyester]] film or to [[vellum]].

The process starts with original documents that have been created on a translucent medium. Such media include polyester films, [[vellum]]s, linens, and translucent [[bond paper]]s (bonds). Any media that allows some light to pass through typically works as a master; the desired durability of the master determines the choice. Depending on the thickness and type of the master, the intensity of the [[ultraviolet|UV]] exposure light is adjusted using an intensity knob typically pre-marked for media types commonly used for masters in any particular shop. Similarly, the speed control (for setting the speed at which the sheets are pulled through the machine) is likewise typically pre-marked in any particular shop, having been optimized based on trial runs.

The original document is laid on top of the chemically-coated side of a sheet of diazo paper, which is retrieved from a light-protected flat file, and the two sheets are fed into the diazo duplicator, being pulled into the machine by rotating rubber friction wheels. There are two chambers inside the machine. The first is the exposure area, where the sandwich of the two sheets (the master and the diazo paper) pass in front of an [[ultraviolet]] lamp. Ultraviolet light penetrates the original and neutralizes the light sensitive diazonium salt wherever there was no image on the master. These areas become the white areas on the copy. Once this process is complete, the undeveloped image at the locations where the UV light could not penetrate can often be seen as very light yellow or white marks/lines on the diazo sheet. This completes the exposure phase.

Next, the original is peeled from the diazo paper as the sandwich of master and diazo exits the machine, and the diazo sheet alone is fed into the developing chamber. Here, fumes of [[ammonium hydroxide]] create an extremely [[alkaline]] environment. Under these conditions, the azodyes (couplers) react with the remaining diazonium salt and undergo a chemical reaction that results in the unexposed lines changing color from invisible (or yellow) to a visible dark color. The range of colors for these lines is usually blue or black, but [[Sepia (color)|sepia]] (a brownish hue) is also quite popular. When making multiple copies of an original no more than four or five copies can typically be made at a time, due to the build-up of [[ammonia]] fumes, even with ventilation fans in the duplication room.  A slight delay of perhaps five minutes is often required for the fumes to subside enough to permit making additional copies if no ventilation exists.  Many blueprint shops ran ventilation ducts from the machines to outside.   Smaller and mid-size blueprint machines were often outfitted with ammonia neutralizer absorbers which absorbed some of the ammonia for a period of time.

If the lines are too light, it is also possible to run the blue-line through the developing chamber once more, which often increases the contrast of the lines relative to the base media.  Repeated lack of contrast and light prints is also a tip-off that the operator needs to adjust the speed or amount of ammonia.  Sometimes both the master and the diazo print are inadvertently fed through the developing chamber together. If this occurs, one simply peels the master from the diazo paper and runs the diazo sheet through the developer once more to more fully develop the lines.

Diazo printing was one of the most economic methods to reproduce large engineering and architectural drawings.

==Fading prints==
A quirk of diazo blueline prints is that with continued exposure to ultraviolet light, either from natural sunlight or from typical office fluorescent lighting, a blueline copy can fade over a span of months (indoors) or just days (outdoors), becoming illegible. This fading process thus requires reduplication of the original documents every few months in a typical office for any project using bluelines. Hence, blueline drawings that are used as engineering working copy prints have to be protected when not in use by storing them in flat files in the dark. [[Incandescent light]]ing was often used in areas where blueline engineering prints needed to be posted on a wall for long periods to hinder rapid fading.

Improperly exposed bluelines are more likely to fade at an increased rate since the chemical reaction in the ammonia phase continues until the process is completed. But also properly exposed bluelines should not be exposed to the elements, and bluelines kept in flat files or hanging on racks in a cool, dry room often retain the majority of their lines and are able to be subsequently scanned into a digital format for various purposes.

==Document control==
During the 20th century, elaborate color-coding schemes were somewhat standardized in each engineering shop for indicating changes to blueline drawings. For example, revisions could be shown by using contrasting color on the bluelines: red markup of a blueprint copy by the engineer, then yellow markup on the copy by the draftsman who implemented the changes on the original drawing, then brown markup by the checker on a check-print (a ''brown-line''). Finally, the architect or engineer, draftsman, checker and supervisor would sign the original drawing, making it a legal document.

An alternative revision scheme was to use red-lines to indicate additions, yellow-lines to indicate deletions, and green-line tracings for checking (e.g., to confirm conductivities or to add notes to draftsmen on how to make corrections), entered on the copies of blue-line prints that were under engineering control.

Whatever scheme was standardized in each shop had to be documented. Colored lines were entered on the blue-line drawing using colored pencils and identified there. Once the modification process was complete, the red-lined blue-line prints were taken to document control, where the original master was modified to reflect the changes made during the engineering process. New blue-line prints were then be made of the modified master, and the process continued in this iterative manner until completion of the project. The master drawing, incorporating all changes and including the authorizing signatures, was finally archived in a vault.

==Demise of the technology==
The blueline print process was largely abandoned within the architectural/engineering community around the early 2000s. Contributing factors were the development of computer aided drafting and printing, the speed of machine printing, and the introduction of larger [[Xerography|xerographic]] machines from companies like Ricoh and Xerox. The cost of blueline production materials and equipment, the fact that the prints themselves faded in sunlight, and the need to use the pungent chemical ammonia as a developer speeded up its replacement.

[[Image:Protractor2.jpg|thumb|right|A half circle protractor marked in degrees (180°).]]
A '''protractor''' is a [[measuring instrument]], typically made of transparent plastic or glass, for measuring [[angle]]s. Most protractors measure angles in
[[degree (angle)|degree]]s (°). Radian-scale protractors measure angles in [[radians]]. Most protractors are divided into 180 equal parts.

They are used for a variety of mechanical and engineering-related applications, but perhaps the most common use is in geometry lessons in schools.

Some protractors are simple half-discs.  More advanced protractors, such as the [[#Bevel protractor|bevel protractor]], have one or two swinging arms, which can be used to help measure the angle.

== Two Sided Protractor ==
Protractors have traditionally been one-sided. This is thought to be because early manufacturing methods set the tone of future production. Unfortunately, the two number scales on a one-sided protractor often confuse learners when first learning to measure and draw angles.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

However, in 2009, Jake Adamson, a maths teacher working at Musselburgh Grammar School invented and patented the first two sided protractor trademarked &quot;The Angler&quot;. This was a double sided protractor with one scale on each side, avoiding the confusion of having two scales together and enabling easier measuring and drawing of angles. &quot;The Angler&quot; protractor has been widely adopted by schools in the UK.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Bevel protractor==
{{Expert subject|date=January 2012}}

A bevel protractor is a graduated circular protractor with one pivoted arm used for measuring or marking off angles. Sometimes [[Vernier scale]]s are attached to give more precise readings. It has wide application in architectural and mechanical drawing, although its use is decreasing with the availability of modern drawing software or [[CAD]].

Universal bevel protractors are also used by toolmakers, as they measure angles by mechanical contact they are classed as mechanical protractors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magazines1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4eMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=7 July 2011|date=December 1993|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=76–|ISSN=0032-4558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The bevel protractor is used to establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12°{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°.
  
The bevel protractor consists of a beam, a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by thumb nut and clamp. When the edges of the beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way.
  
Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.

The above picture illustrates a variety of uses of the bevel protractor.
 
Reading the Vernier scale:

The bevel protractor Vernier scale may have graduations of 5′ (minutes) or 1/12°. Each space on the Vernier scale is 5′ less than two spaces on the main scale{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}. Twenty four spaces on the Vernier scale equal in extreme length twenty three double degrees{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}. Thus the difference between the space occupied by 2° on a main scale and the space of the Vernier scale is equal to one twenty-fourth of 2°, or 5′.

Read off directly from the main scale the number of whole degrees between 0 on this scale and the 0 of the Vernier scale. Then count, in the same direction, the number of spaces from the zero on the Vernier scale to a line that coincides with a line on the main scale; multiply this number by 5 and the product will be the number of minutes to be added to the whole number of degrees.
 
For example: Zero on the vernier scale has moved 28 whole degrees to the right of the 0 on the main scale and the 3rd line on the vernier scale coincides with a line upon the main scale as  indicated. Multiplying 3 by 5, the product, 15, is the number of minutes to be added to the whole number of degrees, thus indicating a setting of 28 degrees and 15 minutes.

An '''engineering drawing''', a type of [[technical drawing]], is used to fully and clearly define requirements for [[engineering|engineered]] items.

Engineering drawing (the activity) produces engineering drawings (the documents). More than merely the drawing of pictures, it is also a [[language]]—a graphical language that communicates ideas and information from one mind to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_p1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most especially, it communicates all needed information from the engineer who ''designed'' a part to the workers who will ''make'' it.

==Relationship to artistic drawing==

Engineering drawing and artistic drawing are both types of drawing, and either may be called simply &quot;drawing&quot; when the context is implicit. Engineering drawing shares some traits with artistic drawing in that both create pictures. But whereas the purpose of artistic drawing is to convey emotion or artistic sensitivity in some way (subjective impressions), the purpose of engineering drawing is to convey information (objective facts).&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_p1&quot;/&gt; One of the corollaries that follows from this fact is that, whereas anyone can appreciate artistic drawing (even if each viewer has his own unique appreciation), engineering drawing requires some training to understand (like any language); but there is also a high degree of objective commonality in the interpretation (also like other languages).&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_p1&quot;/&gt; In fact, engineering drawing has evolved into a language that is more precise and unambiguous than [[natural language]]s; in this sense it is closer to a [[programming language]] in its communication ability. Engineering drawing uses an extensive set of conventions to convey information very precisely, with very little ambiguity.

==Relationship to other technical drawing types==

The process of producing engineering drawings, and the skill of producing those, is often referred to as '''technical drawing''' or '''drafting''' although technical drawings are also required for disciplines that would not ordinarily be thought of as parts of engineering (such as [[architecture]], [[landscaping]], [[cabinetry|cabinet making]], [[road construction]] and garment-making).

Persons employed in the trade of producing engineering drawings were called draftsmen (or draughtsmen) in the past.  Although these terms are still in use, the non-gender-specific terms draftsperson and drafter are now more common.

==Cascading of conventions by specialty==

The various fields share many common conventions of drawing, while also having some field-specific conventions. For example, even within metalworking, there are some process-specific conventions to be learned—[[casting]], [[machining]], [[fabrication (metal)|fabricating]], and assembly all have some special drawing conventions, and within fabrication there is further division, including [[welding]], [[rivet]]ing, [[pipefitter|pipefitting]], and [[ironworker|erecting]]. Each of these trades has some details that only specialists will have memorized.

==Legal instruments==

An engineering drawing is a legal document (that is, a [[legal instrument]]), because it communicates all the needed information about &quot;what is wanted&quot; to the people who will expend resources turning the idea into a reality. It is thus a part of a [[contract]]; the [[purchase order]] and the drawing together, as well as any ancillary documents (engineering change orders [ECOs], called-out [[specification (technical standard)|specs]]), constitute the contract. Thus, if the resulting product is wrong, the worker or manufacturer are protected from [[Legal liability|liability]] as long as they have faithfully executed the instructions conveyed by the drawing. If those instructions were wrong, it is the fault of the engineer. Because manufacturing and construction are typically very expensive processes (involving large amounts of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[payroll]]), the question of liability for errors has great [[legal]] implications as each party tries to blame the other and assign the wasted cost to the other's responsibility. This is the biggest reason why the conventions of engineering drawing have evolved over the decades toward a very precise, unambiguous state.

==Standardization and disambiguation==

Engineering drawings specify requirements of a component or assembly which can be complicated. Standards provide rules for their specification and interpretation. In 2011, a new revision of ISO 8015 was published containing the Invocation Principle. This states that, &quot;Once a portion of the ISO geometric product specification (GPS) system is invoked in a mechanical engineering product documentation, the entire ISO GPS system is invoked.&quot; It also goes on to state that marking a drawing &quot;Tolerancing ISO 8015&quot; is optional. The implication of this is that any drawing using ISO symbols can only be interpreted to ISO GPS rules. The only way not to invoke the ISO GPS system is to invoke a national or other standard. Now in 2015 there is a new standardisation called BS 8888, this is now used for all standard and technical drawings.

Since there are only two widely standardized definitions of size, there is only one real alternative to ISO GPS, i.e. [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] Y14.5 and Y14.5M (most recently revised in 2009). Standardization also aids [[internationalization]], because people from different countries who speak different languages can read the same engineering drawing, and interpret it the same way. To that end, drawings should be as free of notes and abbreviations as possible so that the meaning is conveyed graphically.

Important note! The 'manufacturing' of a technical drawing however is as difficult as the actual production of the design it describes. Therefore engineers must think very clearly about what is placed on a drawing, i.e [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing|Dimensioning and tolerancing]] principles. (GD&amp;T). Ideally each party knows exactly how to read and interpret such principles, but practise shows it is not as easy.

==Media==

For centuries, until the post-World War II era, all engineering drawing was done manually by using pencil and pen on paper or other substrate (e.g., [[vellum]], [[mylar]]). Since the advent of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), engineering drawing has been done more and more in the electronic medium with each passing decade. Today most engineering drawing is done with CAD, but pencil and paper have not disappeared.

Some of the [[technical drawing tools|tools of manual drafting]] include pencils, pens and their ink, [[straightedge]]s, [[T-square]]s, [[French curve]]s, triangles, [[ruler]]s, [[protractor]]s, [[caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]], [[compass (drafting)|compasses]], scales, erasers, and tacks or push pins. ([[Slide rule]]s used to number among the supplies, too, but nowadays even manual drafting, when it occurs, benefits from a pocket [[calculator]] or its onscreen equivalent.) And of course the tools also include drawing boards (drafting boards) or tables. The English idiom &quot;to go back to the drawing board&quot;, which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether, was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing. [[Drafting machine]]s are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards, straightedges, [[pantograph]]s, and other tools into one integrated drawing environment. CAD provides their virtual equivalents.

Producing drawings usually involves creating an original that is then reproduced, generating multiple copies to be distributed to the shop floor, vendors, company archives, and so on. The classic reproduction methods involved blue and white appearances (whether [[blueprint|white-on-blue]] or [[whiteprint|blue-on-white]]), which is why engineering drawings were long called, and even today are still often called, &quot;[[blueprint]]s&quot; or &quot;[[whiteprint|bluelines]]&quot;, even though those terms are [[anachronism|anachronistic]] from a literal perspective, since most copies of engineering drawings today are made by more modern methods (often [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] or [[laser printer|laser]] printing) that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper.  The more generic term &quot;print&quot; is now in common usage in the U.S. to mean any paper copy of an engineering drawing. In the case of CAD drawings, the original is the CAD file, and the [[printout]]s of that file are the &quot;prints&quot;.

==Relationship to model-based definition (MBD/DPD)==

For centuries, engineering drawing was the sole method of transferring information from design into manufacture. In recent decades another method has arisen, called [[model-based definition]] (MBD) or digital product definition (DPD). In MBD, the information captured by the CAD software app is fed automatically into a CAM app ([[computer-aided manufacturing]]), and is translated via postprocessor into other languages such as [[G-code]], which is executed by a CNC machine tool ([[numerical control|computer numerical control]]). Thus today it is often the case that the information travels from the mind of the designer into the manufactured component without having ever been codified by an engineering drawing. In MBD, the [[data set|dataset]], not a drawing, is the legal instrument. The term &quot;technical data package&quot; (TDP) is now used to refer to the ''complete package of information'' (in one medium or another) that communicates information from design to production (such as 3D-model datasets, engineering drawings, engineering change orders (ECOs), [[specification (technical standard)|spec]] revisions and addenda, and so on). However, even in the MBD era, where theoretically production could happen without any drawings or humans at all, it is still the case that drawings and humans are involved. It still takes CAD/CAM programmers, CNC setup workers, and CNC operators to do manufacturing, as well as other people such as quality assurance staff (inspectors) and logistics staff (for materials handling, shipping-and-receiving, and [[front office]] functions). These workers often use drawings in the course of their work that have been produced by rendering and plotting (printing) from the MBD dataset. 
When proper procedures are being followed, a clear chain of precedence is always documented, such that when a person looks at a drawing, s/he is told by a note thereon that this drawing is not the governing instrument (because the MBD dataset is). In these cases, the drawing is still a useful document, although legally it is classified as &quot;for reference only&quot;, meaning that if any controversies or discrepancies arise, it is the MBD dataset, not the drawing, that governs.

== Systems of dimensioning and tolerancing ==

Almost all engineering drawings (except perhaps reference-only views or initial sketches) communicate not only geometry (shape and location) but also dimensions and [[engineering tolerance|tolerances]] for those characteristics. Several systems of dimensioning and tolerancing have evolved. The simplest dimensioning system just specifies distances between points (such as an object's length or width, or hole center locations). Since the advent of well-developed [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable manufacture]], these distances have been accompanied by tolerances of the plus-or-minus or min-and-max-limit types. ''Coordinate dimensioning'' involves defining all points, lines, planes, and profiles in terms of Cartesian coordinates, with a common origin. Coordinate dimensioning was the sole best option until the post-World War II era saw the development of [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] (GD&amp;T), which departs from the limitations of coordinate dimensioning (e.g., rectangular-only tolerance zones, tolerance stacking) to allow the most logical tolerancing of both geometry and dimensions (that is, both form [shapes/locations] and sizes).

== Engineering drawings: common features ==
Drawings convey the following critical information:

* ''Geometry'' – the shape of the object; represented as views; how the object will look when it is viewed from various angles, such as front, top, side, etc.
* ''Dimensions'' – the size of the object is captured in accepted units.
* ''[[Tolerance (engineering)|Tolerances]]'' – the allowable variations for each dimension.
* ''Material'' – represents what the item is made of.
* ''Finish'' – specifies the surface quality of the item, functional or cosmetic. For example, a mass-marketed product usually requires a much higher surface quality than, say, a component that goes inside industrial machinery.

=== Line styles and types ===
[[File:Line types.png|right|thumb|210px|Standard engineering drawing line types]]
A variety of line styles graphically represent physical objects. Types of ''lines'' include the following:
* ''visible'' – are continuous lines used to depict edges directly visible from a particular angle.
* ''hidden'' – are short-dashed lines that may be used to represent edges that are not directly visible.
* ''center'' – are alternately long- and short-dashed lines that may be used to represent the axes of circular features.
* ''cutting plane'' – are thin, medium-dashed lines, or thick alternately long- and double short-dashed that may be used to define sections for [[cross section (geometry)|section views]].
* ''section'' – are thin lines in a pattern (pattern determined by the material being &quot;cut&quot; or &quot;sectioned&quot;) used to indicate surfaces in section views resulting from &quot;cutting.&quot; Section lines are commonly referred to as &quot;cross-hatching.&quot;
* ''phantom'' - (not shown) are alternately long- and double short-dashed thin lines used to represent a feature or component that is not part of the specified part or assembly.  E.g. billet ends that may be used for testing, or the machined product that is the focus of a tooling drawing.

Lines can also be classified by a letter classification in which each line is given a letter.
* '''Type A''' lines show the outline of the feature of an object. They are the thickest lines on a drawing and done with a pencil softer than HB.
* '''Type B''' lines are dimension lines and are used for dimensioning, projecting, extending, or leaders. A harder pencil should be used, such as a 2H pencil.
* '''Type C''' lines are used for breaks when the whole object is not shown. These are freehand drawn and only for short breaks. 2H pencil
* '''Type D''' lines are similar to Type C, except these are zigzagged and only for longer breaks. 2H pencil
* '''Type E''' lines indicate hidden outlines of internal features of an object. These are dotted lines. 2H pencil
* '''Type F''' lines are Type F''[typo]'' lines, except these are used for drawings in electrotechnology. 2H pencil
* '''Type G''' lines are used for centre lines. These are dotted lines, but a long line of 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm, then a gap, then a small line of 2&amp;nbsp;mm. 2H pencil
* '''Type H''' lines are the same as type G, except that every second long line is thicker. These indicate the cutting plane of an object. 2H pencil 
* '''Type k''' lines indicate the alternate positions of an object and the line taken by that object. These are drawn with a long line of 10-
20&amp;nbsp;mm, then a small gap, then a small line of 2&amp;nbsp;mm, then a gap, then another small line. 2H pencil.

===Multiple views and projections===
[[File:First angle projection.svg|thumb|right|200px|Image of a part represented in First Angle Projection]]
[[File:Conventions of placing vues in technical drawings.svg|thumb|right|200px|Symbols used to define whether a projection is either First Angle (left) or Third Angle (right).]]
[[File:Engineering drawing isometric.svg|thumb|right|200px|Isometric view of the object shown in the engineering drawing [[#Example of an engineering drawing|below]].]]
{{Main|Graphical projection}} 
In most cases, a single view is not sufficient to show all necessary features, and several views are used. Types of ''views'' include the following:

==== Orthographic projection ====
The [[orthographic projection]] shows the object as it looks from the front, right, left, top, bottom, or back, and are typically positioned relative to each other according to the rules of either [[Multiview orthographic projection|first-angle or third-angle projection]]. The origin and vector direction of the projectors (also called projection lines) differs, as explained below. 
* In '''first-angle projection, the projectors originate as if radiated ''from a viewer's eyeballs'' and shoot ''through'' the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the plane ''behind'' it.''' The 3D object is projected into 2D &quot;paper&quot; space as if you were looking at a [[radiograph]] of the object: the top view is under the front view, the right view is at the left of the front view. First-angle projection is the [[ISO 128|ISO standard]] and is primarily used in Europe.
* In '''third-angle projection, the projectors originate as if radiated ''from the 3D object itself'' and shoot ''away from'' the 3D object to project a 2D image onto the plane ''in front of'' it.''' The views of the 3D object are like the panels of a box that envelopes the object, and the panels pivot as they open up flat into the plane of the drawing.&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_pp99-105&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|pp=99–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the left view is placed on the left and the top view on the top; and the features closest to the front of the 3D object will appear closest to the front view in the drawing. Third-angle projection is primarily used in the United States and Canada, where it is the default projection system according to [[ASME]] standard ASME Y14.3M.

Until the late 19th century, first-angle projection was the norm in North America as well as Europe;&lt;ref name=&quot;French1918p78&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|French|1918}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6R5DAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 78].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_pp111-114&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|pp=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but circa the 1890s, the meme of third-angle projection spread throughout the North American engineering and manufacturing communities to the point of becoming a widely followed convention,&lt;ref name=&quot;French1918p78&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_pp111-114&quot;/&gt; and it was an ASA standard by the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_pp111-114&quot;/&gt; Circa World War I, British practice was frequently mixing the use of both projection methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;French1918p78&quot;/&gt;

As shown above, the determination of what surface constitutes the front, back, top, and bottom varies depending on the projection method used.

Not all views are necessarily used.&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_pp97-114&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|pp=97–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally only as many views are used as are necessary to convey all needed information clearly and economically.&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_pp108-111&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|pp=108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front, top, and right-side views are commonly considered the core group of views included by default,&lt;ref name=&quot;French_Vierck_1953_p102&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|1953|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  but any combination of views may be used depending on the needs of the particular design. In addition to the 6 principal views (front, back, top, bottom, right side, left side), any auxiliary views or sections may be included as serve the purposes of part definition and its communication. View lines or section lines (lines with arrows marked &quot;A-A&quot;, &quot;B-B&quot;, etc.) define the direction and location of viewing or sectioning. Sometimes a note tells the reader in which zone(s) of the drawing to find the view or section.

==== Auxiliary projection ====
An auxiliary view is an orthographic view that is projected into any plane other than one of the six principal views.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoline, Gary R. ''Introduction to Graphics Communications for Engineers (4th Ed.).'' New York, NY. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  These views are typically used when an object contains some sort of inclined plane.  Using the auxiliary view allows for that inclined plane (and any other significant features) to be projected in their true size and shape.  The true size and shape of any feature in an engineering drawing can only be known when the Line of Sight (LOS) is perpendicular to the plane being referenced.
It is shown like a three-dimensional object.

==== Isometric projection ====
The [[isometric projection]] shows the object from angles in which the scales along each axis of the object are equal. Isometric projection corresponds to rotation of the object by ± 45° about the vertical axis, followed by rotation of approximately ± 35.264° [= arcsin(tan(30°))] about the horizontal axis starting from an orthographic projection view. &quot;Isometric&quot; comes from the Greek for &quot;same measure&quot;. One of the things that makes isometric drawings so attractive is the ease with which 60 degree angles can be constructed with only a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] and straightedge.

Isometric projection is a type of [[axonometric projection]]. The other two types of axonometric projection are:
* [[Dimetric projection]]
* [[Trimetric projection]]

==== Oblique projection ====
An [[oblique projection]] is a simple type of graphical projection used for producing pictorial, two-dimensional [[image]]s of three-dimensional objects: 
* it projects an image by intersecting parallel rays (projectors)
* from the three-dimensional source object with the drawing surface (projection plan).
In both oblique projection and orthographic projection, parallel lines of the source object produce parallel lines in the projected image.

==== Perspective ====
[[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] is an approximate representation on a flat surface, of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are drawn:
* Smaller as their distance from the observer increases
* Foreshortened: the size of an object's dimensions along the line of sight are relatively shorter than dimensions across the line of sight.

==== Section Views ====
Projected views (either Auxiliary or Orthographic) which show a cross section of the source object along the specified cut plane.  These views are commonly used to show internal features with more clarity than may be available using regular projections or hidden lines.  In assembly drawings, hardware components (e.g. nuts, screws, washers) are typically not sectioned.

=== Scale ===
{{Main|Architect's scale|Engineer's scale|Metric scale}}
Plans are usually &quot;scale drawings&quot;, meaning that the plans are drawn at specific [[ratio]] relative to the actual size of the place or object. Various scales may be used for different drawings in a set. For example, a floor plan may be drawn at 1:50 (1:48 or {{frac|4}}″ = 1′ 0″) whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:25 (1:24 or {{frac|2}}″ = 1′ 0″). Site plans are often drawn at 1:200 or 1:100.

Scale is a nuanced subject in the use of engineering drawings. On one hand, it is a general principle of engineering drawings that they are projected using standardized, mathematically certain projection methods and rules. Thus, great effort is put into having an engineering drawing accurately depict size, shape, form, [[aspect ratio]]s between features, and so on. And yet, on the other hand, there is another general principle of engineering drawing that nearly diametrically opposes all this effort and intent—that is, the principle that ''users are not to scale the drawing to infer a dimension not labeled.'' This stern admonition is often repeated on drawings, via a boilerplate note in the title block telling the user, &quot;DO NOT SCALE DRAWING.&quot;

The explanation for why these two nearly opposite principles can coexist is as follows. The first principle—that drawings will be made so carefully and accurately—serves the prime goal of why engineering drawing even exists, which is successfully communicating part definition and acceptance criteria—including &quot;what the part should look like if you've made it correctly.&quot;  The service of this goal is what creates a drawing that one even ''could'' scale and get an accurate dimension thereby. And thus the great temptation to do so, when a dimension is wanted but was not labeled. The second principle—that even though scaling the drawing ''will'' usually work, one should nevertheless ''never'' do it—serves several goals, such as enforcing total clarity regarding who has authority to discern design intent, and preventing erroneous scaling of a drawing that was never drawn to scale to begin with (which is typically labeled &quot;drawing not to scale&quot; or &quot;scale: NTS&quot;). When a user is forbidden from scaling the drawing, s/he must turn instead to the engineer (for the answers that the scaling would seek), and s/he will never erroneously scale something that is inherently unable to be accurately scaled.

But in some ways, the advent of the [[computer-aided design|CAD]] and [[model-based definition|MBD]] era challenges these assumptions that were formed many decades ago. When part definition is defined mathematically via a solid model, the assertion that one cannot interrogate the model—the direct analog of &quot;scaling the drawing&quot;—becomes ridiculous; because when part definition is defined this way, it is not ''possible'' for a drawing or model to be &quot;not to scale&quot;. A 2D pencil drawing can be inaccurately foreshortened and skewed (and thus not to scale), yet still be a completely valid part definition as long as the labeled dimensions are the only dimensions used, and no scaling of the drawing by the user occurs. This is because what the drawing and labels convey is in reality a ''symbol'' of what is wanted, rather than a true ''replica'' of it. (For example, a sketch of a hole that is clearly not round still accurately defines the part as having a true round hole, as long as the label says &quot;10mm DIA&quot;, because the &quot;DIA&quot; implicitly but objectively tells the user that the skewed drawn circle is a symbol ''representing'' a perfect circle.) But if a mathematical model—essentially, a vector graphic—is declared to be the official definition of the part, then any amount of &quot;scaling the drawing&quot; can make sense; there may still be an error in the model, in the sense that what was ''intended'' is not ''depicted'' (modeled); but there can be no error of the &quot;not to scale&quot; type—because the mathematical vectors and curves are replicas, not symbols, of the part features.

Even in dealing with 2D drawings, the manufacturing world has changed since the days when people paid attention to the scale ratio claimed on the print, or counted on its accuracy. In the past, prints were plotted on a plotter to exact scale ratios, and the user could know that a line on the drawing 15mm long corresponded to a 30mm part dimension because the drawing said &quot;1:2&quot; in the &quot;scale&quot; box of the title block. Today, in the era of ubiquitous desktop printing, where original drawings or scaled prints are often scanned on a scanner and saved as a PDF file, which is then printed at any percent magnification that the user deems handy (such as &quot;fit to paper size&quot;), users have pretty much given up caring what scale ratio is claimed in the &quot;scale&quot; box of the title block. Which, under the rule of &quot;do not scale drawing&quot;, never really did that much for them anyway.

=== Showing dimensions ===

=== Sizes of drawings ===
{{Main|Paper size}}
[[File:A size illustration.svg|thumb|ISO paper sizes]]
[[File:ANSI_size_illustration.svg|thumb|ANSI paper sizes]]

Sizes of drawings typically comply with either of two different standards, [[ISO standard|ISO]] (World Standard) or [[ANSI/ASME Y14.1]] (American).

The metric drawing sizes correspond to international [[paper size]]s. These developed further refinements in the second half of the twentieth century, when [[photocopying]] became cheap. Engineering drawings could be readily doubled (or halved) in size and put on the next larger (or, respectively, smaller) size of paper with no waste of space. And the metric [[technical pen]]s were chosen in sizes so that one could add detail or drafting changes with a pen width changing by approximately a factor of the [[square root of 2]]. A full set of pens would have the following nib sizes: 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm. However, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) called for four pen widths and set a colour code for each: 0.25 (white), 0.35 (yellow), 0.5 (brown), 0.7 (blue); these nibs produced lines that related to various text character heights and the ISO paper sizes.

All ISO paper sizes have the same aspect ratio, one to the square root of 2, meaning that a document designed for any given size can be enlarged or reduced to any other size and will fit perfectly. Given this ease of changing sizes, it is of course common to copy or print a given document on different sizes of paper, especially within a series, e.g. a drawing on A3 may be enlarged to A2 or reduced to A4.

The U.S. customary &quot;A-size&quot; corresponds to &quot;letter&quot; size, and &quot;B-size&quot; corresponds to &quot;ledger&quot; or &quot;tabloid&quot; size. There were also once British paper sizes, which went by names rather than alphanumeric designations.

[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) [[ANSI/ASME Y14.1]], Y14.2, Y14.3, and Y14.5 are commonly referenced standards in the U.S.

=== Technical lettering ===
[[Technical lettering]] is the process of forming letters, numerals, and other [[character (computing)|characters]] in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for, an object. With the goals of [[legibility]] and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a [[sans-serif|Gothic sans-serif]] script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of [[machine]]s. ISO Lettering templates, designed for use with technical pens and pencils, and to suit ISO paper sizes, produce lettering characters to an international standard.  The stroke thickness is related to the character height (for example, 2.5mm high characters would have a stroke thickness - pen nib size - of 0.25mm, 3.5 would use a 0.35mm pen and so forth). The ISO character set (font) has a seriffed one, a barred seven, an open four, six, and nine, and a round topped three, that improves legibility when, for example, an A0 drawing has been reduced to A1 or even A3 (and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed &amp;c). When CAD drawings became more popular, especially using US American software, such as AutoCAD, the nearest font to this ISO standard font was Romantic Simplex (RomanS) - a proprietary shx font) with a manually adjusted width factor (over ride) to make it look as near to the ISO lettering for the drawing board. However, with the closed four, and arced six and nine, romans.shx typeface could be difficult to read in reductions. In more recent revisions of software packages, the [[TrueType]] font ISOCPEUR reliably reproduces the original drawing board lettering stencil style, however, many drawings have switched to the ubiquitous Arial.ttf.

==Conventional parts (areas) of an engineering drawing==

===Title block===
The title block (T/B, TB) is an area of the drawing that conveys [[header (computing)|header]]-type information about the drawing, such as: 
* Drawing title (hence the name &quot;title block&quot;)
* Drawing number
* [[Part number]](s)
* Name of the design activity (corporation, government agency, etc.)
* Identifying code of the design activity (such as a [[Commercial and Government Entity|CAGE code]])
* Address of the design activity (such as city, state/province, country)
* Measurement units of the drawing (for example, inches, millimeters)
* Default tolerances for dimension callouts where no tolerance is specified
* Boilerplate callouts of general [[specification (technical standard)|specs]]
* [[Intellectual property]] rights warning

Traditional locations for the title block are the bottom right (most commonly) or the top right or center.

===Revisions block===
The revisions block (rev block) is a tabulated list of the revisions (versions) of the drawing, documenting the [[revision control]].

Traditional locations for the revisions block are the top right (most commonly) or adjoining the title block in some way.

===Next assembly===
The next assembly block, often also referred to as &quot;where used&quot; or sometimes &quot;effectivity block&quot;, is a list of higher assemblies where the product on the current drawing is used.  This block is commonly found adjacent to the title block.

===Notes list===
The notes list provides notes to the user of the drawing, conveying any information that the callouts within the field of the drawing did not. It may include general notes, flagnotes, or a mixture of both.

Traditional locations for the notes list are anywhere along the edges of the field of the drawing.

====General notes====
General notes (G/N, GN) apply generally to the contents of the drawing, as opposed to applying only to certain part numbers or certain surfaces or features.

====Flagnotes====
Flagnotes or flag&amp;nbsp;notes (FL, F/N) are notes that apply only where a flagged callout points, such as to particular surfaces, features, or part numbers. Typically the callout includes a flag icon. Some companies call such notes &quot;delta notes&quot;, and the note number is enclosed inside a triangular symbol (similar to [[delta (letter)|capital letter delta]], Δ). &quot;FL5&quot; (flagnote 5) and &quot;D5&quot; (delta note 5) are typical ways to abbreviate in [[ASCII]]-only contexts.

===Field of the drawing===
The field of the drawing (F/D, FD) is the main body or main area of the drawing, excluding the title block, rev block, and so on.

===List of materials, bill of materials, parts list===
The list of materials (L/M, LM, LoM), bill of materials (B/M, BM, BoM), or parts list (P/L, PL) is a (usually tabular) list of the materials used to make a part, and/or the parts used to make an assembly. It may contain instructions for heat treatment, finishing, and other processes, for each part number. Sometimes such LoMs or PLs are separate documents from the drawing itself.

Traditional locations for the LoM/BoM are above the title block, or in a separate document.

===Parameter tabulations===
Some drawings call out dimensions with parameter names (that is, variables, such a &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), then tabulate rows of parameter values for each part number.

Traditional locations for parameter tables, when such tables are used, are floating near the edges of the field of the drawing, either near the title block or elsewhere along the edges of the field.

===Views and sections===
Each view or section is a separate set of projections, occupying a contiguous portion of the field of the drawing. Usually views and sections are called out with cross-references to specific zones of the field.

===Zones===
Often a drawing is divided into zones by a grid, with zone labels along the margins, such as A,B,C,D up the sides and 1,2,3,4,5,6 along the top and bottom. Names of zones are thus, for example, A5, D2, or B1. This feature greatly eases discussion of, and reference to, particular areas of the drawing.

==Abbreviations and symbols==
{{main|Engineering drawing abbreviations and symbols}}
As in many technical fields, a wide array of abbreviations and symbols have been developed in engineering drawing during the 20th and 21st centuries. For example, [[cold rolled steel]] is often abbreviated as CRS, and [[diameter]] is often abbreviated as [[Engineering drawing abbreviations and symbols|DIA, D, or ⌀]].

== Example of an engineering drawing ==
[[File:Mech draw 1.svg|thumb|200px|Example mechanical drawing]]
Here is an example of an engineering drawing (an isometric view of the same object is shown above). The different line types are colored for clarity.

*Black = object line and hatching
*Red = hidden line
*Blue = center line of piece or opening
*Magenta = phantom line or cutting plane line

Sectional views are indicated by the direction of arrows,as in the example right side.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1792">'''BS 8888''' is the [[British Standards|British standard]] developed by the [[BSI Group]] for technical product documentation, geometric product specification, geometric tolerance specification and engineering drawings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/News-Room/BSI-News-Content/Sectors/ICT--Telecommunications/Newly-Revised-BS-88882006-Technical-Product-Specification/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[BS 308]] was formally the standard for engineering drawing since 1927. Over a period of 73 years it was expanded and edited until its withdrawal in 2000. The [[BSI Group]], who produced the standard, played an important role in the development of the international standard on technical specification in conjunction with the ISO. In 2000, the [[BS 308]] was replaced by the updated BS 8888.

===2013 update===
A significant change in the 2013 revision is that there is no longer a requirement to state whether specifications have been toleranced in accordance with either the Principle of Independency or the Principle of Dependency.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Purpose==
BS 8888 performs three fundamental tasks:
*Unifying all the ISO standards applicable to technical specification;
*Giving an index of ISO standards involved with different principles of technical product specification (TPS);
*Providing BSI with a platform for further explanatory commentary where necessary.

[[File:A size illustration2 with letter and legal.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ISO A series and a comparison with American letter and legal formats.]]
[[File:Comparison paper sizes.svg|thumb|Comparison of some paper and photographic paper sizes close to the A4 size.]]
Many '''paper size''' standards conventions have existed at different times and in different countries. Today, the A and B series of [[ISO 216]], which includes the popular A4 size, are the international standard used by almost every country. The only exceptions are United States and Canada, where the &quot;[[Letter (paper size)|Letter]]&quot; is more prevalent. Paper sizes affect writing paper, [[stationery]], cards, and some printed documents. The international standard for envelopes is the C series of [[ISO 269]].

==Grain==
Most industry standards express the direction of the grain last when giving dimensions (that is, 17&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;11 inches is short grain paper and 11&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;17 inches is long grain paper), although alternatively the grain alignment can be explicitly indicated with an underline (&lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;17 is short grain) or the letter &quot;M&quot; for &quot;machine&quot; (11M&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;17 is short grain). Grain is important because paper will crack if folded across the grain: for example, if a sheet 17&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;11 inches is to be folded to divide the sheet into two 8.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;11 halves, then the grain will be along the 11-inch side.&lt;ref name=&quot;xerox-grain&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.xerox.com/printer-supplies/paper-stock/paper-grain/enus.html
| title = Paper Grain &amp; Smoothness: Don't Go Against the Grain
| publisher = [[Xerox]] Corp.
| quote = A paper mill may indicate paper grain on carton and ream labels, product brochures, swatch books and price lists in several ways:&lt;br /&gt;1. You may see the words Grain Long or Grain Short.&lt;br /&gt;2. The dimension parallel to the grain may be underscored. For example, 8.5x&lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt; indicates long grain, while &lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt;x17 indicates short grain.&lt;br /&gt;3. &quot;M&quot; may be used to indicate machine direction, for example, 11Mx17 indicates short grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fold paper parallel to the grain direction. Paper folded against the grain may be rough and crack along the folded edge. The heavier the paper, the more likely roughness and cracking will occur.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper intended to be fed into a machine that will bend the paper around rollers, such as a [[printing press]], [[photocopier]], or [[typewriter]], should be fed grain side first so that the axis of the rollers is along the grain.

==International paper sizes==
{{Main article|ISO 216}}
{{Hatnote|See [[Switching barriers|Switching costs]], [[Network effect]]s and [[Standardization]] for possible reasons for differing regional adoption rates of the ISO standard sizes.}}

The international paper size standard is [[ISO 216]].  It is based on the German [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 476 standard for paper sizes. ISO paper sizes are all based on a single [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of [[square root of 2]], or approximately 1:1.4142. There are different series, as well as several extensions.

===A series===
[[File:A size illustration2.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ISO A series.]]
The base A0 size of paper is defined as having an area of 1&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}}. Rounded to the nearest millimetre, the A0 paper size is {{convert|841|x|1189|mm|in}}.

Successive paper sizes in the series A1, A2, A3, and so forth, are defined by halving the preceding paper size across the larger dimension. This also effectively halves the area of each sheet. The most frequently used paper size is A4 measuring {{convert|210|x|297|mm|in|sigfig=3}}.

The significant advantage of this system is its scaling: if a sheet with an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} is divided into two equal halves parallel to its shortest sides, then the halves will again have an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}}. Folded brochures of any size can be made by using sheets of the next larger size, e.g. A4 sheets are folded to make A5 brochures. The system allows scaling without compromising the [[aspect ratio]] from one size to another—as provided by office photocopiers, e.g. enlarging A4 to A3 or reducing A3 to A4. Similarly, two sheets of A4 can be scaled down and fit exactly 1 sheet without any cutoff or margins.

The behavior of the aspect ratio is easily proven: on a sheet of paper, let ''a'' be the long side and ''b'' be the short side; thus, {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}. When the sheet of paper is folded in half widthwise, let ''c'' be the length of the new short side: ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''a''|2}}. If we take the ratio of the newly folded paper we have:

&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{b}{c}=\frac{b}{\frac{a}{2}}=\frac{2}{\frac{a}{b}}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the aspect ratio is preserved for the new dimensions of the folded paper.

[[Paper density#Basis weight|Weight]]s are easy to calculate as well: a standard A4 sheet made from 80&amp;nbsp;g/m{{sup|2}} paper weighs 5&amp;nbsp;g (as it is {{frac|16}} of an A0 page, measuring 1&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}}), allowing one to easily compute the weight—and associated postage rate—by counting the number of sheets used.

The advantages of basing a paper size upon an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} were first noted in 1786 by the [[Germany|German]] scientist and philosopher [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/lichtenberg-letter.html |title=Lichtenberg’s letter to Johann Beckmann |publisher=Cl.cam.ac.uk |date=2006-02-07 |accessdate=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formats that became A2, A3, B3, B4 and B5 were developed in France on proposition of the mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] and published for judiciary purpose in 1798 during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;B237&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |date=1798-11-03 |title=Loi sur le timbre (Nº 2136) |journal=Bulletin des lois de la République |publisher=French government |location=Paris |issue=237 |pages=1–2 |language=French |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/loi-timbre.html |accessdate=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 20th century, Dr Walter Porstmann turned Lichtenberg's idea into a proper system of different paper sizes. Porstmann's system was introduced as a DIN standard (DIN 476) in Germany in 1922, replacing a vast variety of other paper formats. Even today, the paper sizes are called &quot;DIN A4&quot; ({{IPA-de|diːn.ʔaː.fiːɐ̯|IPA}}) in everyday use in Germany and Austria.

The DIN 476 standard spread quickly to other countries. Before the outbreak of [[World War II]], it had been adopted by the following countries:
{{col-begin}} {{col-1-of-3}}
* Belgium (1924)
* [[Netherlands]] (1925)
* Norway (1926)

{{col-2-of-3}}

* [[Finland]] (1927)
* Switzerland (1929)
* Sweden (1930)

{{col-3-of-3}}

* [[Soviet Union]] (1934)
* Hungary (1938)
* Italy (1939)

{{col-end}}

During World War II, the standard was adopted by [[Uruguay]] (1942), [[Argentina]] (1943) and [[Brazil]] (1943), and afterwards spread to other countries:

{{col-begin}} {{col-1-of-3}}
* Spain (1947)
* Austria (1948)
* [[Iran]] (1948)
* [[Romania]] (1949)

* [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]) (1953)
* Israel (1954)
* [[Portugal]] (1954)
* [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] (now [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) (1956)

* Mexico (1965)
* [[South Africa]] (1966)
* France (1967)
* [[Peru]] (1967)
* [[Turkey]] (1967)
{{col-3-of-3}}

* [[Thailand]] (1973)
* [[Barbados]] (1973)
* Australia (1974)
* [[Ecuador]] (1974)
* [[Colombia]] (1975)
* [[Kuwait]] (1975)
{{col-end}}

By 1975, so many countries were using the German system that it was established as an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard, as well as the official [[United Nations]] document format. By 1977, A4 was the standard letter format in 88 of 148 countries.  Today the standard has been adopted by all countries in the world except the United States and Canada. In Mexico, [[Costa Rica]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], and the [[Philippines]], the [[Letter (paper size)|US letter]] format is still in common use, despite their official adoption of the ISO standard.

===B series===
[[File:B size illustration2.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ISO B series.]]
In addition to the A series, there is a less common B series. The area of B series sheets is the [[geometric mean]] of successive A series sheets. So, B1 is between A0 and A1 in size, with an area of 0.707&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}} ({{frac|{{sqrt|2}}}}&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}}). As a result, B0 is 1 metre wide, and other sizes in the B series are a half, a quarter or further fractions of a metre wide. While less common in office use, it is used for a variety of special situations. Many posters use B-series paper or a close approximation, such as 50&amp;nbsp;cm × 70&amp;nbsp;cm; B5 is a relatively common choice for books. The B series is also used for [[envelope]]s and [[passport]]s. The B-series is widely used in the [[printing]] industry to describe both paper sizes and [[printing press]] sizes, including [[Digital printing|digital presses]]. B3 paper is used to print two US letter or A4 pages side by side using [[imposition]]; four pages would be printed on B2, eight on B1, etc.

===C series===
[[File:C size illustration2.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ISO C series.]]
The C series is usually used for envelopes and is defined in ISO 269. The area of C series sheets is the geometric mean of the areas of the A and B series sheets of the same number; for instance, the area of a C4 sheet is the geometric mean of the areas of an A4 sheet and a B4 sheet. This means that C4 is slightly larger than A4, and slightly smaller than B4. The practical usage of this is that a letter written on A4 paper fits inside a C4 envelope, and C4 paper fits inside a B4 envelope.

The [[tolerances]] specified in the standard are
* ±1.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.06&amp;nbsp;in) for dimensions up to 150&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in),
* ±2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.08&amp;nbsp;in) for lengths in the range 150 to 600&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9 to 23.6 in) and
* ±3&amp;nbsp;mm (0.12&amp;nbsp;in) for any dimension above 600&amp;nbsp;mm (23.6&amp;nbsp;in).

===German extensions===
The German standard '''DIN 476''' was published in 1922 and is the original specification of the A and B sizes. It differs in two details from its international successor:

DIN 476 provides for formats larger than A0, denoted by a prefix factor. In particular, it lists the formats 2A0 and 4A0, which are twice and four times the size of A0 respectively:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ DIN 476 overformats
! Name !! mm × mm !! in × in
|-
! 4A0
| 1682 × 2378|| 66.22 × 93.62
|-
! 2A0
| 1189 × 1682|| 46.81 × 66.22
|}

However, DIN 216:2007 notes 2A0 and 4A0 in the table of Main series of trimmed sizes (ISO-A series) as well. &quot;The rarely used sizes [2A0 and 4A0] which follow also belong to this series&quot;

DIN 476 also specifies slightly tighter tolerances:
* ±1&amp;nbsp;mm (0.04&amp;nbsp;in) for dimensions up to 150&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in),
* ±1.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.06&amp;nbsp;in) for lengths in the range 150&amp;nbsp;mm to 600&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9 to 23.6 in) and
* ±2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.08&amp;nbsp;in) for any dimension above 600&amp;nbsp;mm (23.6&amp;nbsp;in).

The Swedish standard SS 014711&lt;ref name=&quot;ss014711&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Papper&amp;nbsp;— Formatserier A-G |url=http://www.sis.se/pappersteknik/pappersprodukter/ss-14711 |work=Svensk standard |publisher=Swedish Standards Institute |accessdate=30 October 2013 }} {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;  generalized the ISO system of A, B, and C formats by adding D, E, F, and G formats to it. Its D format sits between a B format and the next larger A format (just like C sits between A and the next larger B). The remaining formats fit in between all these formats, such that the sequence of formats A4, E4, C4, G4, B4, F4, D4, ''H4'', A3 is a [[geometric progression]], in which the dimensions grow by a factor {{radic|2|16}} from one size to the next. However, the SIS 014711 standard does not define any size between a D format and the next larger A format (called H in the previous example). Of these additional formats, G5 (169 × 239&amp;nbsp;mm) and E5 (155 × 220&amp;nbsp;mm) are popular in Sweden and the Netherlands for printing dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://ki.se/content/1/c6/05/90/62/Typography_en.pdf |publisher=Karolinska University press |title=Print format for dissertations }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the other formats have not turned out to be particularly useful in practice and they have not been adopted internationally.

===Japanese B-series variant===
The [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] defines two main series of paper sizes. The JIS A-series is identical to the ISO A-series, but with slightly different tolerances. The area of B-series paper is 1.5 times that of the corresponding A-paper (instead of the factor {{sqrt|2}} = 1.414... for the ISO B-series), so the length ratio is approximately 1.22 times the length of the corresponding A-series paper. The aspect ratio of the paper is the same as for A-series paper. Both A- and B-series paper is widely available in Japan, [[Taiwan]] and China, and most photocopiers are loaded with at least A4 and either one of A3, B4 and B5 paper.

There are also a number of traditional paper sizes, which are now used mostly by printers. The most common of these old series are the Shiroku-ban and the Kiku paper sizes.

===Colombian common sizes naming===

The most common paper sizes used for commercial and industrial printing in Colombia are close to the ISO B1, B2 and B3 and are referred to as ''pliego'', ''{{frac|1|2}} pliego'' and ''{{frac|1|4}} pliego'' respectively. The &quot;Arch B&quot; size is known as ''extratabloide''.

In commercial and academic typesetting, the most common paper size is ''carta'', equivalent to US Letter (8.5&quot; by 11&quot;).  In legal papers ''oficio'' is used equivalent to 8.5&quot; by 13&quot; which is shorter than US Legal.

The United States, Canada and Mexico use a different system of paper sizes compared to the rest of the world.  The current standard sizes are unique to that continent, although due to the size of the North American market and proliferation of both software and printing hardware from the region, other parts of the world have become increasingly familiar with these sizes (though not necessarily the paper itself).  The traditional North American inch-based sizes differ from those [[#Traditional inch-based paper sizes|described below]].

==== Common loose sizes ====
''Letter, Legal'' and ''Ledger/Tabloid'' are by far the most commonly used of these for everyday activities, and the only ones included in [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS).

The origins of the exact dimensions of Letter size paper ({{convert|8+1/ 2|×|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are lost in tradition and not well documented. The American Forest and Paper Association argues that the dimension originates from the days of manual paper making, and that the 11-inch length of the page is about a quarter of &quot;the average maximum stretch of an experienced vatman's arms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;US&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afandpa.org/paper.aspx?id=511 |title=Why is the standard paper size in the U.S. 8½&quot; x 11&quot;? |accessdate=2009-08-04 |author=American Forest and Paper Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192919/http://www.afandpa.org/paper.aspx?id=511 |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not explain the width or aspect ratio.

Outside of North America, Letter size may also be known as &quot;American Quarto&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsguide.com/junior-legal-paper-size/ |title=Junior Legal Paper Size |publisher=Dimensions Guide |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704081857/http://www.dimensionsguide.com/junior-legal-paper-size/ |archivedate=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If one accepts some trimming, the size is indeed one quarter of the old Imperial paper size known as Demy, {{convert|17+1/ 2|×|22+1/ 2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fyffe |first=Charles |title=Basic Copyfitting |publisher=Studio Vista |year=1969 |location=London |isbn=0-289-79705-5 |page=74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--==== Usage and adoption ====--&gt;
US paper sizes are currently standard in the United States, the Philippines and Chile. The latter two use US Letter, but their Legal size is {{convert|8+1/ 2|×|13|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=91260 |title=Request for inclusion of Page Size 8.5&quot;×13&quot; |accessdate=2008-08-11 |first=Rally |last=de Leon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico has adopted the ISO standard, but US Letter format is still the system in use throughout the country. It is virtually impossible to encounter ISO standard papers in day-to-day uses, with &quot;Carta 216&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;279&amp;nbsp;mm&quot; (Letter), &quot;Oficio 216&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;340&amp;nbsp;mm&quot; (Government-Legal) and &quot;Doble carta&quot; (Ledger/Tabloid) being nearly universal. US sizes are also widespread and in common use in Colombia and some other American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armada.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=251610&amp;download=Y |title=Armada mil |accessdate=2010-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, US paper sizes are a de facto standard. The government, however, also uses ISO paper sizes. The Canadian standard CAN 2-9.60M &quot;Paper Sizes for Correspondence&quot; specifies P1 through P6 paper sizes, which are the [[#ANSI paper sizes|ANSI paper sizes]] rounded to the nearest 5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html |title= International standard paper sizes |accessdate=2008-03-06 |last=Kuhn |first=Markus }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Variant loose sizes ====
There is an additional paper size, {{convert|8|×|10+1/ 2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, to which the name ''Government-Letter'' was given by the [[IEEE]] [[Printer Working Group]] (PWG). It was prescribed by [[Herbert Hoover]] when he was [[Secretary of Commerce]] to be used for US government forms, apparently to enable discounts from the purchase of paper for schools, but more likely due to the standard use of trimming books (after binding) and paper from the standard letter size paper to produce consistency and allow &quot;bleed&quot; printing. In later years, as photocopy machines proliferated, citizens wanted to make photocopies of the forms, but the machines did not generally have this size paper in their bins. [[Ronald Reagan]] therefore had the US government switch to regular Letter size, which is both half an inch longer and wider.&lt;ref name=&quot;US&quot; /&gt; The former government size is still commonly used in spiral-bound [[notebook]]s, for children's writing and the like, a result of trimming from the current Letter dimensions.

By extension of the American standards, the halved Letter size, {{convert|5+1/ 2|×|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, meets the needs of many applications. It is variably known as ''Statement'', ''Stationery'', ''Memo'', ''Half Letter'', ''Half A'' (from ANSI sizes) or simply ''Half Size''. Like the similar-sized ISO A5, it is used for everything from personal letter writing to official aeronautical maps. Organizers, notepads, and diaries also often use this size of paper; thus 3-ring binders are also available in this size. Booklets of this size are created using word processing tools with landscape printing in two columns on letter paper which are then cut or folded into the final size.&lt;!--

--&gt;

==== Standardized American paper sizes ====
{{anchor|ANSI paper sizes}}[[File:ANSI size illustration2.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ANSI sizes.]]
In 1996, the [[American National Standards Institute]] adopted [[ANSI/ASME Y14.1]] which defined a regular series of paper sizes based upon the ''de facto'' standard {{convert|8+1/ 2|×|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Letter size which it assigned &quot;ANSI A&quot;. This series also includes Ledger/Tabloid as &quot;ANSI B&quot;. This series is somewhat similar to the ISO standard in that cutting a sheet in half would produce two sheets of the next smaller size. Unlike the ISO standard, however, the arbitrary aspect ratio forces this series to have two alternating aspect ratios. For example, ANSI A is less elongated than A4, while ANSI B is more elongated than A3.

With care, documents can be prepared so that the text and images fit on either ANSI or their equivalent ISO sheets at 1:1 reproduction scale.

|}

Other, larger sizes continuing the alphabetic series illustrated above exist, but it should be noted that they are not part of the series ''per se'', because they do not exhibit the same aspect ratios. For example, Engineering F size is {{convert|28|×|40|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} with ca. 1.4286:1; it is commonly required for [[NAVFAC]] drawings, but is generally less commonly used.  G size is {{convert|22+1/ 2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} high, but it is a [[roll format]] with a variable width up to {{convert|90|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in increments of {{convert|8+1/ 2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. H through N sizes are also roll formats.

Such huge sheets were at one time used for full-scale layouts of aircraft parts, automotive parts, wiring harnesses and the like, but are slowly being phased out, due to widespread use of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM). Some visual arts fields also continue to use these paper formats for large-scale printouts, such as for displaying digitally painted character renderings at life-size as references for makeup artists and costume designers, or to provide an immersive landscape reference.

==== Architectural sizes ====
[[File:ARCH PAPER SIZES v3.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the Architectural sizes.]]
In addition to the ANSI system as listed above, there is a corresponding series of paper sizes used for [[architecture|architectural]] purposes. This series also shares the property that bisecting each size produces two of the size below, with alternating aspect ratios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arch E1&quot;&gt;except for size Arch E1&lt;/ref&gt; It may be preferred by North American architects because the aspect ratios (4:3 and 3:2) are ratios of small integers, unlike their ANSI (or ISO) counterparts. Furthermore, the aspect ratio 4:3 matches the traditional aspect ratio for computer displays.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arch E1&quot; /&gt; The architectural series, usually abbreviated &quot;Arch&quot;, is shown below:

===Tablet sizes===
{{See also|Notebook}}

The sizes listed above are for paper sold loose in [[paper ream|ream]]s. There are many sizes of tablets of paper, that is, sheets of paper bound at one edge, usually by a strip of plastic or hardened [[polyvinyl acetate|PVA adhesive]]. Often there is a pad of [[paperboard|cardboard]] (also known as [[Paperboard|chipboard]] or [[greyboard]]) at the bottom of the stack. Such a tablet serves as a portable writing surface, and the sheets often have lines printed on them, usually in [[Non-photo blue|non-repro blue]], to make writing in a line easier. An older means of binding is to have the sheets stapled to the cardboard along the top of the tablet; there is a line of perforated holes across every page just below the top edge from which any page may be torn off. Lastly, a pad of sheets each weakly stuck with adhesive to the sheet below, trademarked as &quot;[[Post-It]]&quot; or &quot;Stick-Em&quot; and available in various sizes, serve as a sort of tablet.

&quot;Letter pads&quot; are {{convert|8+1/2|by|11|in|mm|1}}, while the term &quot;legal pad&quot; is often used by laymen to refer to pads of various sizes including those of {{convert|8+1/2|by|14|in|mm|1}}. There are &quot;steno pads&quot; (used by [[stenography|stenographers]]) of {{convert|6|by|9|in|mm|1}}.

In countries where the ISO sizes are standard, most notebooks and tablets are sized to ISO specifications (for example, most newsagents in Australia stock A4 and A3 tablets).

==Traditional inch-based paper sizes==
&lt;!-- [[Foolscap]] links to this section --&gt;

Traditionally, a number of different sizes were defined for large sheets of paper, and paper sizes were defined by the sheet name and the number of times it had been folded.  Thus a full sheet of &quot;royal&quot; paper was 25&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;20 inches, and &quot;royal octavo&quot; was this size folded three times, so as to make eight sheets, and was thus 10&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;{{frac|6|1|4}} inches.

Imperial sizes were used in the United Kingdom and its territories. Some of the base sizes were as follows:

[[Foolscap folio]] is often referred to simply as &quot;folio&quot; or &quot;foolscap&quot;.  Similarly, &quot;quarto&quot; is more correctly &quot;copy draught quarto&quot;.

Many of these sizes were only used for making books (see [[bookbinding]]), and would never have been offered for ordinary stationery purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trussel.com/books/booksize.htm |title=Book sizes, with reference tables }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demitab===
The '''demitab''' or '''demi-tab''' (from the French &quot;demi&quot; or half tabloid) is {{convert|5+1/2|x|8+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, equal to one quarter of a sheet of {{convert |11|x|17|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[L size|tabloid]] size paper. In actual circulation, the size {{convert|8|x|10+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} is common for a demitab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://horizonpublications.ca/html/max_image_area.php |publisher=Horizon Publications |title=Max Image Area }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tabloid (newspaper format)#Tabloid-sized newspapers|Tabloid]] newspapers, which are &quot;generally half the size of a broadsheet&quot;, also vary in size. To add to the lack of uniformity, [[broadsheet]]s also vary in size.

==Transitional paper sizes==

===PA series===

A transitional size called '''PA4''' ({{convert|210|×|280|mm|in|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) was proposed for inclusion into the ISO 216 standard in 1975. It has the height of Canadian P4 paper (215&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;× 280&amp;nbsp;mm, about {{frac|8|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;× 11&amp;nbsp;in) and the width of international A4 paper ({{convert|210|×|297|mm|in|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), i.e. it uses the smaller value among the two for each side. The table below, shows how this format can be generalized into an entire format series.

The PA formats did not end up in ISO 216, because the committee decided that the set of standardized paper formats should be kept to the minimum necessary. However, PA4 remains of practical use today. In [[landscape format|landscape]] orientation, it has the same 4:3 aspect ratio as the displays of traditional TV sets, some [[computer displays]] and [[data projector]]s. PA4, with appropriate [[margin (typography)|margin]]s, is therefore a good choice as the format of presentation slides.

PA4, sometimes dubbed ''L4'', is also a useful compromise between A4 and North American Letter sizes. Hence it is used today by many international [[magazine]]s, because it can be printed easily on equipment designed for either A4 or US Letter. That means it is not as much a paper size than a page format.

|}

===Antiquarian===

Although the movement is towards the international standard metric paper sizes, on the way there from the traditional ones there has been at least one new size just a little larger than that used internationally. British architects and industrial designers once used a size called &quot;Antiquarian&quot; as listed above, but given in the ''New Metric Handbook'' (Tutt &amp; Adler 1981) as {{convert|813|×|1372|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} for board size. This is a little larger than the A0 size. So for a short time, a size called A0a ({{convert|1000|×|1370|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) was used in Britain.

In extreme examples, some broadsheet papers are nearly as narrow as traditional tabloids.

'''Helix''' is a family-run [[United Kingdom]]-based manufacturer of scholastic [[stationery]]. It currently{{when?|date=August 2016}} employs 75 people, and exports to over 65 countries, with offices in [[Chicago]] and [[Hong Kong]] and with UK headquarters based in [[Lye, West Midlands]].

== History ==
Helix was established in 1887 under the name, '''The Universal Woodworking Company Ltd.'''; it manufactured wooden [[Ruler|rules]] and metal laboratory apparatus. In 1894, it patented the [[Compass (drafting)|drawing compass]] and, with it, launched the Helix brand, following on from the initial success of the compass and rule. In 1912, the company's first mathematical set was created and, in 1935, the brand &quot;Helix Oxford&quot; was launched. 1955 saw the company become known as the '''Helix Universal Company''', moving its headquarters to Lye, where it is still based today. In the 1960s, the name again changed to its current name '''Helix International Ltd.'''.
Helix is now part of the French owned [[Maped]] group.

== Brands ==
* Helix
* Splat and Tribe- fashion stationery
* Helix Oxford- high quality mathematical instruments and stationery
* Helix Technical- technical drawing instruments for older students and professional use

== Administration ==
On Monday 23 January 2012,tThe company made the following announcement, &quot;Over the last few months, the Directors of Helix have been working towards a financial restructuring with the aim of securing the future of the Helix brand, its business and employees. The administration is an integral part of this process and Helix is continuing to trade in the short term, as we hope to conclude a deal in the next few days in order to achieve our objective. We will, of course, keep you informed of developments as they occur.&quot;

[[Image:Sample Floorplan.jpg|thumb|320px|Sample floor plan for a [[single-family detached home]]]]{{views}}
In [[architecture]] and [[building engineering]], a '''floor plan''' is a drawing to [[Scale (ratio)|scale]], showing a view from above, of the relationships between rooms, spaces and other physical features at one level of a structure.

Dimensions are usually drawn between the walls to specify room sizes and wall lengths. Floor plans may also include details of fixtures like sinks, water heaters, furnaces, etc. Floor plans may include notes for construction to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items.

It is also called a ''[[Plan view|plan]]'' which is a measured plane typically projected at the floor height of {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}}, as opposed to an ''[[Elevation (view)|elevation]]'' which is a measured plane projected from the side of a building, along its height, or a section or ''[[cross section (geometry)|cross section]]'' where a [[building]], is cut along an axis to reveal the interior structure.

==Overview==
Similar to a [[map]] the orientation of the view is downward from above, but unlike a conventional [[map]], a plan is drawn at a particular vertical position (commonly at about 4 feet above the floor). Objects below this level are seen, objects at this level are shown 'cut' in plan-section, and objects above this vertical position within the structure are omitted or shown dashed. [[Plan view]] or planform is defined as a vertical [[orthographic projection]] of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.

The term may be used in general to describe any drawing showing the physical layout of objects. For example, it may denote the arrangement of the displayed objects at an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]], or the arrangement of exhibitor booths at a [[Convention (meeting)|convention]]. Drawings are now reproduced using [[Plotter|plotters]] and large format [[xerographic]] copiers.

A ''reflected ceiling plan'' (RCP) shows a view of the room as if looking from above, through the ceiling, at a mirror installed one foot below the ceiling level, which shows the ''reflected'' image of the ceiling above. This convention maintains the same orientation of the floor and ceilings plans - looking down from above.  RCPs are used by designers and architects to demonstrate lighting, visible mechanical features, and ceiling forms as part of the documents provided for construction.

==Floor plan topics==

===Building blocks===
A floor plan is not a top view or [[birds eye view]].  It is a measured drawing to scale of the layout of a floor in a building.  A ''top view'' or ''bird's eye view'' does not show an orthogonally projected plane cut at the typical 4 foot height above the floor level.  A floor plan could show:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanjoseca.gov/planning/counter/planning_sanjose/Planning_in_San_Jose_pt3.pdf Site Plans, Elevations and Floor Plans] ''A Community Guide San Jose''. Accessed 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interior walls and hallways
* Restrooms
* Windows and doors
* Appliances such as stoves, refrigerators, water heater etc.
* Interior features such as fireplaces, saunas and whirlpools
* The use of all rooms

===Plan view===
A [[plan view]] is an [[orthographic projection]] of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a horizontal plane through the object. In other words, a plan is a [[Cross section (geometry)|section]] viewed from the top. In such views, the portion of the object above the plane (section) is omitted to reveal what lies beyond. In the case of a floor plan, the roof and upper portion of the walls may typically be omitted.

Roof plans are orthographic projections, but they are not sections as their viewing plane is outside of the object.

A plan is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. It is often used in [[technical drawing]] and is traditionally crosshatched. The style of crosshatching indicates the type of material the section passes through.

===3D Floor plans===
A [[3D floor plan]] can be defined as a virtual model of a building floor plan. It's often used to better convey architectural plans to individuals not familiar with floor plans. Despite the purpose of floor plans originally being to depict 3D layouts in a 2D manner, technological expansion has made rendering 3D models much more cost effective. 3D plans show a better depth of image and are often complimented by 3D furniture in the room. This allows a greater appreciation of scale than with traditional 2D floor plans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dakaravirtual.co.uk/about-us.html#3dfloorplan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[architecture]] an '''architectural plan''' is a [[design]] and planning for a [[building]], and can contain [[architectural drawing]]s, specifications of the design, calculations, time planning of the building process, and other documentation. 

== The term &quot;Architectural plan&quot; ==
The term &quot;Architectural plan&quot; can have multiple related meanings:
* [[Plan]] for an [[architectural]] project
* [[Documentation]] of written and graphic descriptions of the architectural elements of a building project including sketches, drawings and details. This effort could also include both the design of new buildings and other structures, as well as the planning for reconstruction of early historic structures.
* architectural [[design]]
* [[Floor plan]]
* [[Scale drawing]] of a structure, for example &quot;the architectural plans for City Hall were on file&quot;
This article will focus on the general meaning of architectural plan as a plan and documentation for a building project.

== Architectural plan aspects ==
=== Buildings ===
{{main|building}}
A [[building]] is a man-made structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place. Buildings come in a variety of shapes, sizes and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, to land prices, ground conditions, specific uses and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures. The gallery below gives an overview of different types of building.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of [[professional]]s and [[Tradesperson|trades]]. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project.

=== Design process ===
A design process may include a series of steps followed by designers. Depending on the product or service, some of these stages may be irrelevant, ignored in real-world situations in order to save time, reduce cost, or because they may be redundant in the situation. Typical stages of the design process include:
*Pre-production design
** [[Design brief]] - a statement of design goals
** [[wiktionary:Analysis|Analysis]] - analysis of current design goals
** [[Research]] - investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
** [[Specification]] - specifying requirements of a design solution 
** [[Problem solving]] - [[concept]]ualizing and [[document]]ing design solutions
** [[Presentation]] - presenting design solutions
*Design during production
** [[Product development|Development]] - continuation and improvement of a designed solution
** [[Test (assessment)|Test]]ing - [[in-situ]] testing a designed solution
*Post-production design feedback for future designs
** [[Implementation]]  - introducing the designed solution into the environment
** [[Evaluation]] and [[Result|conclusion]] - summary of process and results, including [[constructive criticism]] and suggestions for future improvements
*Redesign - any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections made) at any time before, during, or after production.

=== Architectural drawing ===
{{main|Architectural drawing}}
Architectural drawings are used by [[architect]]s and others for a number of purposes: to develop a design idea into a coherent proposal, to communicate ideas and concepts, to convince clients of the merits of a design, to enable a [[building contractor]] to construct it, as a record of the completed work, and to make a record of a building that already exists.

Architectural drawings are made according to a set of [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], which include particular views (floor plan, section etc.), sheet sizes, units of measurement and scales, annotation and cross referencing. Conventionally, drawings were made in ink on paper or a similar material, and any copies required had to be laboriously made by hand. The twentieth century saw a shift to drawing on tracing paper, so that mechanical copies could be run off efficiently.

=== Architectural design values ===
{{Main|Architectural design values}}
Architectural design values make up an important part of what influences [[architect]]s and [[designer]]s when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different [[Architectural style|architectural movements]]. It also differs between different [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] and schools of design as well as among individual [[List of architects|architects]] and [[List of industrial designers|designers]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. ISBN 82-547-0174-1.[http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Floor plan ===
{{Main|Floor plan}}
[[File:Sample Floorplan.jpg|thumb|[[Floor plan]] for a single-family home]]
One of the major tools in architectural design is the [[floor plan]]. This diagram shows the relationships between rooms, spaces and other physical features at one level of a structure. Dimensions are usually drawn between the walls to specify room sizes and wall lengths. Floor plans will also include details of fixtures like sinks, water heaters, furnaces, etc. Floor plans will include notes to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items.

Similar to a [[map]] in a floor plan  the orientation of the view is downward from above, but unlike a conventional [[map]], a plan is understood to be drawn at a particular vertical position (commonly at about 4 feet above the floor). Objects below this level are seen, objects at this level are shown 'cut' in plan-section, and objects above this vertical position within the structure are omitted or shown dashed. [[Plan view]] or &quot;[[planform]]&quot; is defined as a vertical [[orthographic projection]] of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.

=== Planning ===
A [[plan]] is typically any procedure used to achieve an [[Objective (goal)|objective]]. It is a set of intended actions, through which one expects to achieve a [[goal]]. Plans can be formal or informal:
* Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in [[project]]s, [[diplomacy]], [[career]]s, [[economic development]], [[military]] campaigns, [[combat]], or in the conduct of other [[business]].
* Informal or [[Ad hoc|ad-hoc]] plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.

=== Building construction ===
{{Main|Construction}}
Building construction is the process of preparing for and forming [[building]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Sturgis&quot; &gt;Sturgis, Russell. &quot;Construction def. B. and &quot;Building&quot; def. A. ''Sturgis' illustrated dictionary of architecture and building: an unabridged reprint of the 1901-2 edition''. Mineola, N.Y.: Dover, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and building systems.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Nikolas, and Erkki Jokiniemi. &quot;Construction&quot; def. 1-5. ''Dictionary of architecture and building construction''. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Architectural Press, 2008. 93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction starts with planning, design, and financing and continues until the structure is ready for occupancy. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of [[human multitasking]]. Normally, the job is managed by a [[project manager]], and supervised by a [[construction manager]], [[design engineer]], [[construction engineer]] or [[project architect]]. For the successful [[Project management|execution]] of a [[project]], effective [[planning]] is essential.

== Related types of design ==
=== Garden design ===
{{Main|Garden design}}
Garden design is the art and process of designing and creating plans for layout and planting of [[garden]]s and [[landscape]]s. Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise.  Most professional garden designers are trained in principles of design and in [[horticulture]], and have an expert knowledge and experience of using plants. Some professional garden designers are also [[landscape architect]]s, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license.  Many amateur gardeners also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study or [[Master Gardener Programs]] offered by the [[American Horticultural Society]].

=== Landscape design ===
{{Main|Landscape planning}}
Landscape planning is a branch of [[landscape architecture]]. Urban [[park system]]s and [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]]s of the type planned by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] are key examples of urban landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners can look beyond the  'closely drawn technical limits' and 'narrowly drawn territorial boundaries' which constrain design projects.

Landscape planners tend to work on projects which:
* are of broad geographical scope
* concern many land uses or many clients
* are implemented over a long period of time
In rural areas, the damage caused by unplanned mineral extraction was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.

=== Site planning ===
[[File:Scottish Parliament site plan.svg|thumb|180px|Example of a site plan]]
A [[site plan]] is an architectural plan, and a detailed [[engineering drawing]] of proposed improvements to a given [[Lot (real estate)|lot]]. A site plan usually shows a building footprint, travelways, parking, drainage facilities, sanitary sewer lines, water lines, trails, lighting, and landscaping.

Such a plan of a site is a graphic [[Depiction|representation]] of the arrangement of buildings, parking, drives, landscaping and any other structure that is part of a [[Real estate development|development]] [[project]].

A site plan is a set of [[construction drawing]]s that a builder or contractor uses to make improvements to a property. Counties can use the site plan to verify that development codes are being met and as a historical resource. Site plans are often prepared by a design consultant who must be either a licensed engineer, architect, landscape architect or land survey. The architect Map is part of a plan in Chandler, AZ.

=== Urban planning ===
[[Image:Hongkong central kowloon-full.jpg|thumb|[[Urban planning]] designs settlements, from the smallest towns to the largest cities.]]
{{Main|Urban planning}}

[[Urban planning|Urban, city, and town planning]] is the integration of the disciplines of [[land use planning]] and [[transport planning]], to explore a very wide range of aspects of the built and social environments of urbanized municipalities and communities. [[Regional planning]] deals with a still larger environment, at a less detailed level.

Another key role of urban planning is [[urban renewal]], and re-generation of [[inner city|inner cities]] by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from long-term infrastructural decay. The picture below is an architecture map of a part of south Chandler, AZ.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan, Paul, Proscio, Tony, ''Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival'', 2000.

A '''ruling pen''' is a drawing instrument for drawing with ink or with other drawing fluids. 

A ruling pen contains ink in a slot between two flexible metal jaws, which are tapered to a point.  It enables precise rendering of the thinnest lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cicale&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Ann |last=Cicale |title=The Art &amp; Craft of Hand Lettering |year=2006 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=978-1-57990-809-6 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The line width can be adjusted by an adjustment screw connecting the jaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirby&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard Shelton |last=Kirby |title=The Fundamentals of Mechanical Drawing |year=1918 |publisher=J.

'''Graph paper''', '''graphing paper''', or '''millimeter paper''' is writing [[paper]] that is printed with fine lines making up a [[regular grid]]. The lines are often used as guides for plotting [[mathematical function]]s or [[experimental data]] and drawing [[two-dimensional graph]]s. It is commonly found in mathematics and engineering education settings and in [[laboratory notebook]]s. Graph paper is available either as [[loose leaf]] paper or bound in [[notebook]]s. It is becoming less common as computer software, such as [[spreadsheet]]s and [[chart|plotting]] software, has supplanted many of the former uses of graph paper.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  Some users of graph paper now print [[Portable Document Format|pdf]] images of the grid pattern as needed rather than buying it pre-printed. There are websites that will generate pdfs of graph paper to the user's specifications.

== Formats ==
* '''Quad paper''' is a common form of graph paper with a sparse grid printed in light blue or gray and right to the edge of the paper. This is often four squares to the inch for work not needing too much detail. It is sometimes referred to as ''quadrille paper''.
* '''Engineering paper''' is traditionally printed on light green or tan translucent paper.  The grid lines are printed on the back side of each page and show through faintly to the front side.  Each page has an unprinted margin.  When [[Photocopier|photocopied]] or [[Image scanner|scanned]], the grid lines typically do not show up in the resulting copy, which often gives the work a neat, uncluttered appearance.  In the US and Canada, some engineering professors require student [[homework]] to be completed on engineering paper.
* '''[[Genkō yōshi]]''' &amp;ndash; A type of manuscript paper used in Japan, normally printed with 400 squares in two sets of 20 lines of 10, used for compositions written in [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|vertical script]].
*'''Hexagonal paper''' shows regular hexagons instead of squares. These can be used to map geometric [[Tiling by regular polygons|tiled or tesselated]] designs among other uses
* '''Isometric graph paper''' or '''3D graph paper''' is a triangular graph paper which uses a series of three guidelines forming a 60° grid of small triangles. The triangles are arranged in groups of six to make hexagons. The name suggests the use for [[isometric projection|isometric views]] or pseudo-three-dimensional views. Among other functions, they can be used in the design of [[trianglepoint]] [[embroidery]]. It can be used to draw angles accurately,
* '''Logarithmic paper''' has rectangles drawn in varying widths corresponding to [[logarithmic scale]]s for [[semi-log plot]]s or [[log-log plot]]s.
*'''Normal [[probability]] paper''' is another graph paper with rectangles of variable widths. It is designed so that &quot;the graph of the normal distribution function is represented on it by a straight line&quot;, i.e. it can be used for a [[normal probability plot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eom-prob&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Probability_graph_paper&amp;oldid=11790 |title=Probability graph paper |work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics |first=A. V. |last=Prokhorov |year=2011 |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Polar coordinate paper''' has concentric circles divided into small arcs or 'pie wedges' to allow plotting in [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]].

In general, graphs showing grids are sometimes called '''Cartesian''' graphs because the square can be used to map measurements onto a [[cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian (x vs. y)]] coordinate system. It is also available without lines but with dots at the positions where the lines would intersect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9039">'''ISO 128''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|international standard]] (ISO), about the general principles of [[presentation]] in [[technical drawing]]s, specifically the [[graphical representation]] of [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] on [[technical drawing]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 128-1:2003&quot;&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32462 ISO 128-1:2003 Abstract]. Accessed 1 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Since 2003 the ISO 128 standard contains twelve parts, which had been initiated between 1996 and 2003. It starts with a summary of the general rules for the execution of technical drawings, as well as presenting the structure. Further it describes basic conventions for [[wikt:line|line]]s, [[Graphical projection|view]]s, cuts and [[Cross section (geometry)|Sections]], and different types of [[engineering drawing]]s, such for mechanical engineering and construction in architectural, civil engineering, shipbuilding etc. It is applicable to both manual and computer-based drawings, but it is not applicable to three-dimensional [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] models.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO 128-1:2003&quot;/&gt;

The ISO 128 replaced the previous DIN 6 standard about drawings, projections and views, which was first published in 1922, and later updated in 1950 and 1968. The ISO 128 itself was first published in 1982, contained 15 pages and &quot;specified the general principles of presentation to be applied to [[technical drawings]] following the [[orthographic projection]] methods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techstreet.com/cgi-bin/detail?product_id=23666 ISO 128] techstreet.com, 2009.)&lt;/ref&gt; Several parts of this standard have been updated by individual parts and eventually the last parts and the whole standard as a whole has been withdrawn by the ISO in 2001.

A thirteenth part was added in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10410">'''Graphic communication''' as the name suggests is [[communication]] using [[graphic]] elements. These elements include symbols such as [[glyph]]s and [[icon]]s, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of [[substrate (printing)|substrate]], color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating [[word]]s and [[image]]s to convey [[data]], [[concept]]s, and [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;GCC08&quot;&gt;[http://teched.vt.edu/GCC/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html Definition of Graphic Communications] GRAPHIC COMM CENTRAL, 2008. Accessed 25 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;GCC08&quot;/&gt;

== Overview ==
Graphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as [[drawings]], [[photograph]]s, [[Photographic slide|slide]]s, and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.

Any medium that uses a [[graphics]] to aid in conveying a [[message]], [[Education|instruction]], or an [[idea]] is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the [[drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Goetsch et al. (1999). ''Technical Drawing''. ISBN 0-7668-0531-X. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are [[cave paintings]] and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period from 40,000–10,000 [[Before Christ|B.C.]] or earlier. Many of these were found to record astronomical, seasonal, and chronological details.

Some of the earliest graphics and drawings known to the [[modern world]], from almost 6,000 years ago, are that of engraved [[stone tablets]] and ceramic [[cylinder seals]], marking the beginning of the historic periods and the keeping of records for accounting and inventory purposes. Records from Egypt predate these and [[papyrus]] was used by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] as a material on which to plan the building of [[pyramids]]; they also used slabs of [[limestone]] and [[wood]]. From 600–250 BC, the Greeks played a major role in [[geometry]]. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

== Graphic communication topics ==
=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone to [[brand]], inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[Line Art]], [[graphics|graphs]], [[diagrams]], [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs, [[maps]], [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. [[Graphic design]] may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.

=== Communication ===
[[Communication]] is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a [[media (communication)|medium]]. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are [[Sound|auditory]] means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal]], physical means, such as [[body language]], [[sign language]], [[paralanguage]], [[Haptic perception|touch]], [[eye contact]], by using [[writing]]. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and [[convey]] meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding.  This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication |work=office of superintendent of Public instruction |location=Washington |url=http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/Communications/default.aspx |accessdate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual communication ===
[[Visual communication]] as the name suggests is [[communication]] through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, it includes: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of [[communication]] with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or [[persuade]] a person.  It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference.  There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness.  There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like [[gestures]], body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.

=== Communication design ===
[[Communication design]] is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how  intermission such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, utilizing [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]].

=== Graphic design ===
The term [[graphic design]] can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation.  Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to produce the final result.  Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Common uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design.  For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece.  [[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]] is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

=== Graphical representation ===
The term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]] representation is commonly defined in three ways.
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, &quot;Representation&quot;, in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The object:'' The symbol being represented.
# ''Manner:'' The way the symbol is represented.
# ''Means:'' The material that is used to represent it.
The ''means'' of literary representation is [[language]]. The means of graphical representation are [[graphics]]. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.
The purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.

[[File:Pantograph01.jpg|thumb|Pantograph 3d rendering]]

A '''pantograph''' (Greek roots παντ- &quot;all, every&quot; and γραφ- &quot;to write&quot;, from their original use for copying writing) is a [[Linkage (mechanical)|mechanical linkage]] connected in a manner based on [[parallelogram]]s so that the movement of one pen, in tracing an image, produces identical movements in a second pen. If a line drawing is traced by the first point, an identical, enlarged, or miniaturized copy will be drawn by a pen fixed to the other. Using the same principle, different kinds of pantographs are used for other forms of duplication in areas such as sculpture, minting, engraving and milling.

Because of the shape of the original device, a pantograph also refers to a kind of structure that can compress or extend like an [[accordion]], forming a characteristic [[rhomboidal]] pattern. This can be found in extension arms for wall-mounted mirrors, temporary fences, [[scissor lift]]s, and other [[scissor mechanism]]s such as the [[Pantograph (rail)|pantograph]] used in electric locomotives and trams

== History ==
The first pantograph was constructed in 1603&lt;ref name=GPscheiner&gt;&quot;The Galileo Project — Scheiner, Christoph&quot; (history), Al Van Helden, Galileo Project, 1995, [http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/scheiner.html galileo.rice.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Christoph Scheiner]], who used the device to copy and scale diagrams, but he wrote about the invention over 27 years later, in ''&quot;Pantographice&quot;'' (Rome 1631).&lt;ref&gt;The full title of ''&quot;Pantographice&quot;'' is ''&quot;Pantographice seu Ars delineandi res quaslibet per parallelogrammum lineare seu cavum&quot;'' (Rome 1631).&lt;/ref&gt;
One arm of the pantograph contained a small pointer, while the other held a drawing implement, and by moving the pointer over a diagram, a copy of the diagram was drawn on another piece of paper. By changing the positions of the arms in the linkage between the pointer arm and drawing arm, the scale of the image produced can be changed.

[[File:Eidographe2.svg|thumb|Diagram illustrating the principles used by William Wallace's eidograph]] In 1821, Professor [[William Wallace (mathematician)|William Wallace]] (1768–1843) invented the eidograph to improve upon the practical utility of the pantograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. - Edinburgh, Dickson 1788-1905|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1836|volume=13|pages=418–439, 637|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paBbAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Account%20of%20the%20Invention%20of%20the%20pantograph%20and%20a%20description%20of%20the%20eidograph%2C%20a%20copying%20instrument%20invented%20by%20William%20Wallace&amp;pg=PA418#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Dickson|quote=The Pantograph has no defect in its geometrical prinicples, but, considered as an instrument for practice, it is by no means perfect. It is composed of metallic bars, which turn on five centres ; it is supported on six rollers turning also on centres, and continually changing their direction while they move along the paper ; and when the instrument is used, the force which changes its figure is in some positions applied obliquely, and thus acts at a disadvantage.  In the summer of the year 1821, my attention was directed to copying instruments.  I found that the Pantograph was then the only one used, and I formed the resolution of attempting to invent a new instrument, which should be free from its imperfections. … The Eidograph has been shewn (sic) to every ingenious person who has visited me since 1821,}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eidograph relocates the fixed point to the center of the parallelogram and uses a narrow parallelogram to provide improved mechanical advantages.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sculpture and minting===
In sculpture, a three-dimensional version of the pantograph was used,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=9837 A video with sculptor CS Jagger using a three-dimensional pantograph]&lt;/ref&gt; usually a large boom connected to a fixed point at one end, bearing two rotating pointing needles at arbitrary points along this boom. By adjusting the needles different enlargement or reduction ratios can be achieved. This device, now largely overtaken by [[Computer-aided manufacturing|computer guided]] [[CNC Router|router]] systems that [[3D scanner|scan]] a [[Scale model|model]] and can produce it in a variety of materials and in any desired size,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag03/janfeb03/cronin/cronin.shtml An example of a sculpture being computer carved in marble]&lt;/ref&gt; was invented by inventor and steam pioneer [[James Watt]] (1736–1819) and perfected by [[Benjamin Cheverton]] (1796–1876) in 1836. Cheverton's machine was fitted with a rotating cutting bit to carve reduced versions of well-known sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://writeantiques.com/the-man-who-brought-marble-sculpture-down-to-size/ Cheverton's reducing machine]&lt;/ref&gt; Of course a three-dimensional pantograph can also be used to enlarge sculpture by interchanging the position of the model and the copy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keropiansculpture.com/enlarging_machine.html A large 3D-pantograph in action]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terraz.org/liberty/article.php3?id_article=20 Enlarging a copy of the Statue of Liberty (French) by means of a 3d-pantograph with a scanning wheel and a cutting edge, in clay.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version is still very much in use to reduce the size of large [[relief]] designs for [[coin]]s down to the required size of the coin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/articles/moderncoinminting.asp The use of a pantograph in minting]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustic cylinder duplication===

One advantage of [[phonograph]] and gramophone discs over cylinders in the 1890s&amp;mdash;before electronic amplification was available—was that large numbers of discs could be stamped quickly and cheaply. In 1890, the only ways of manufacturing copies of a master cylinder were to mold the cylinders (which was slow and, early on, produced very poor copies), to record cylinders by the &quot;round&quot;, over and over again, or to acoustically copy the sound by placing the horns of two phonographs together or to hook the two together with a rubber tube (one phonograph recording and the other playing the cylinder back). [[Thomas Edison|Edison]], [[Gianni Bettini|Bettini]], [[Leon Douglass]] and others solved this problem (partly) by mechanically linking a cutting stylus and a playback stylus together and copying the &quot;hill-and-dale&quot; grooves of the cylinder mechanically. When molding improved somewhat, molded cylinders were used as pantograph masters. This was employed by Edison and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in 1898, and was used until about January 1902 (Columbia brown waxes after this were molded). Some companies like the [[United States Phonograph Co.]] of [[Newark, New Jersey]], supplied cylinder masters for smaller companies so that they could duplicate them, sometimes pantographically. Pantographs could turn out about 30 records per day and produce up to about 150 records per master. In theory, pantograph masters could be used for 200 or 300 duplicates if the master and the duplicate were running in reverse and the record would be duplicated in reverse. This, in theory, could extend the usability of a pantograph master by using the unworn/lesser worn part of the recording for duplication. [[Pathé]] employed this system with mastering their vertically-cut records until 1923; a {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}}, {{convert|4|or|6|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} master cylinder, rotating at a high speed, would be recorded on. This was done as the resulting cylinder was considerably loud and of very high fidelity. Then, the cylinder would be placed on the mandrel of a duplicating pantograph that would be played with a stylus on the end of a lever, which would transfer the sound to a wax disc master, which would be electroplated and be used to stamp copies out. This system resulted in some fidelity reduction and rumble, but relatively high quality sound. [[Edison Disc Record|Edison Diamond Disc Records]] were made by recording ''directly'' onto the wax master disc.

=== Milling machines ===

Before the advent of control technologies such as [[numerical control]] (NC and CNC) and [[programmable logic controller|programmable logic control]] (PLC), duplicate parts being milled on a [[milling machine]] could not have their contours mapped out by moving the [[milling cutter]] in a &quot;connect-the-dots&quot; (&quot;by-the-numbers&quot;) fashion. The only ways to control the movement of the cutting tool were to dial the positions by hand using dexterous skill (with natural limits on a human's [[accuracy and precision]]) or to trace a cam, template, or model in some way, and have the cutter mimic the movement of the tracing stylus. If the milling head was mounted on a pantograph, a duplicate part could be cut (and at various scales of magnification besides 1:1) simply by tracing a template. (The template itself was usually made by a [[tool and die maker]] using [[toolroom]] methods, including milling via dialing followed by hand sculpting with [[file (tool)|files]] and/or [[die grinder]] points.) This was essentially the same concept as reproducing documents with a pen-equipped pantograph, but applied to the [[machining]] of hard materials such as metal, wood, or plastic. Pantograph [[router (woodworking)|routing]], which is conceptually identical to pantograph milling, also exists (as does CNC routing). The Blanchard lathe, a [[Thomas Blanchard#Machine tools for gun making and pattern copying lathe|copying lathe developed by Thomas Blanchard]], used the same essential concept.

The development and dissemination throughout industry of NC, CNC, PLC, and other control technologies provided a new way to control the movement of the milling cutter: via feeding information from a program to actuators ([[Servomotor|servos]], [[selsyn]]s, [[leadscrew]]s, machine slides, [[spindle (tool)|spindles]], and so on) that would move the cutter as the information directed. Today most commercial machining is done via such programmable, computerized methods. Home machinists are likely to work via manual control, but computerized control has reached the home-shop level as well (it's just not yet as pervasive as its commercial counterparts). Thus pantograph milling machines are largely a thing of the past. They are still in commercial use, but at a greatly reduced and ever-dwindling level. They are no longer built new by machine tool builders, but a small market for used machines still exists. As for the magnification-and-reduction feature of a pantograph (with the scale determined by the adjustable arm lengths), it is achieved in CNC via mathematic calculations that the computer applies to the program information practically instantaneously. Scaling functions (as well as mirroring functions) are built into languages such as [[G-code]].

=== Other uses ===
Perhaps the pantograph that is most familiar to the general public is the extension arm of an adjustable wall-mounted mirror.

In another application similar to drafting, the pantograph is incorporated into a pantograph engraving machine with a revolving cutter instead of a pen, and a tray at the pointer end to fix precut lettered plates (referred to as 'copy'), which the pointer follows and thus the cutter, via the pantograph, reproduces the 'copy' at a ratio to which the pantograph arms have been set. The typical range of ratio is Maximum 1:1 Minimum 50:1 (reduction) In this way machinists can neatly and accurately [[engraving|engrave]] numbers and letters onto a part.

The device which maintains electrical contact with the [[Railway electrification system|contact wire]] and transfers power from the wire to the [[railway electric traction|traction unit]], used in [[electric locomotive]]s and [[tram]]s, is also called a &quot;[[Pantograph (rail)|pantograph]]&quot;.

Some types of trains on the [[New York City Subway]] use end pantograph gates (which, to avoid interference, compress under spring pressure around curves while the train is en route) to prevent passengers on station platforms from falling  into or riding in the gaps between the cars.

Old-style 'baby gates' used a 2-dimensional pantograph mechanism (in a similar style to pantograph gates on subway cars) as a means of keeping toddlers away from stairways.  The openings in these gates are too large to meet modern baby gate safety standards.

[[Herman Hollerith]]'s &quot;Keyboard punch&quot; used for the [[1890 United States Census|1890 U.S. Census]] was a pantograph design and sometimes referred to as &quot;The Pantograph Punch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Truesdell | first = Leon E. | title = The Development of Punch Card Tabulation in the Bureau of the Census: 1890-1940 | publisher = US GPO | year = 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early 19th-century device employing this mechanism is the [[Polygraph (duplicating device)|polygraph]], which produces a duplicate of a letter as the original is written.

[[Longarm quilting]] machine operators may trace a pantograph, paper pattern, with a laser pointer to stitch a custom pattern onto the quilt.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Digitized pantographs are followed by computerized machines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[Linn Boyd Benton]] invented a pantographic engraving machine for type design, which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design (mathematically, these are cases of [[affine transformation]], which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including [[PostScript]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Pantographs are also used as guide frames in heavy-duty applications including [[scissor lift]]s, [[material handling equipment]], [[stage lift]]s and specialty hinges (such as for panel doors on boats and airplanes).

[[Richard Feynman]] used the analogy of a pantograph as a way of scaling down tools to the nanometer scale in his talk [[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].

Numerous trade-show displays use 3-dimensional pantograph mechanisms to support backdrops for exhibit booths.  The framework expands in 2 directions (vertical and horizontal) from a bundle of connected rods into a self-supporting structure on which a fabric backdrop is hung.&lt;ref&gt;http://thevelocity-grp.com/blog/the-hopup-pop-up-portable-tension-fabric-inline-trade-show-exhibit/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]] and [[science]], a '''cross section''' is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of a body in [[three-dimensional space]] with a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], or the analog in higher-dimensional space. Cutting an object into slices creates many parallel cross sections. A cross section of three-dimensional space that is parallel to two of the [[Axis (mathematics)|axes]] is a [[contour line]]; for example, if a plane cuts through mountains of a [[raised-relief map]] parallel to the ground, the result is a contour line in two-dimensional space showing points of equal [[elevation]].

==Conic sections==
[[File:Conic Sections.svg|300px|left]]

[[Conic sections]] – [[circle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[parabola]]s, and [[hyperbolas]] – are formed by cross-sections of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] at various different angles, as seen in the diagram at left.

Any planar cross-section passing through the center of an [[ellipsoid]] forms an ellipse on its surface, which degenerates to a circle for sections [[perpendicular]] to a symmetry axis.

[[Image:Cylindric section.svg|thumb|120px|Cylindric section.]]
A cross-section of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] is a [[circle]] if the cross-section is parallel to the cylinder's base, or an [[ellipse]] with non-zero [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] (see diagram at right) if it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the base. If the cross-section is perpendicular to the base it consists of two parallel [[line segment]]s (not shown) unless it is just [[tangent line|tangent ]] to the cylinder, in which case it is a single line segment.

==Other mathematical examples==

}}

A cross section of a [[polyhedron]] is a [[polygon]].

A cross section of a [[probability density function#Densities associated with multiple variables|probability density function of two random variables]] in which the cross sectioning plane is at a fixed value of one of the variables is a [[conditional probability distribution|conditional density function]] of the other variable (conditional on the fixed value defining the cross section). If instead the cross section is taken for a fixed value of the density, the result is an [[Ellipse#Ellipses in statistics and finance|iso-density contour]]. For the [[normal distribution]], these contours are ellipses.

A cross section can be used to visualize the [[partial derivative ]] of a function with respect to one of its arguments, as shown at left. Suppose ''z'' = ''f''(''x'', ''y''). In taking the partial derivative of ''f''(''x'', ''y'') with respect to ''x'', one can take a cross section of the function ''f'' at a fixed value of ''y'' to plot ''z'' solely against ''x''; then the partial derivative with respect to ''x'' is the slope of the resulting two-dimensional graph.

In [[economics]], a [[production function]] ''f''(''x'', ''y'') specifies the output that can be produced by various quantities ''x'' and ''y'' of inputs, typically labor and physical capital. The production function of a firm or a society can be plotted in three-dimensional space. If a cross section is taken parallel to the ''x'', ''y'' plane, the result is an [[isoquant]] showing the various combinations of labor and capital usage that would result in the level of output given by the height of the cross section. Alternatively, if a cross section of the production function is taken at a fixed level of ''y''--that is, parallel to the ''x'', ''z'' plane--then the result is a two-dimensional graph showing how much output can be produced at each of various values of usage ''x'' of one input combined with the fixed value of the other input ''y''.

Also in economics, a [[Utility#Cardinal and ordinal utility|cardinal or ordinal utility function]] ''u''(''w'', ''v'') gives the degree of satisfaction of a consumer obtained by consuming quantities ''w'' and '' v'' of two goods. If a cross section of the utility function is taken at a given height (level of utility), the two-dimensional result is an [[indifference curve]] showing various alternative combinations of consumed amounts ''w'' and ''v'' of the two goods all of which give the specified level of utility.

In [[geology]], the structure of the interior of a [[planet]] is often illustrated using a diagram of a cross section of the planet that passes through the planet's center, as in the cross section of [[Earth]] at right.

Cross sections are often used in [[anatomy]] to illustrate the inner structure of an organ, as shown at left.

A cross section of a [[tree]] trunk, as shown at left, reveals [[tree ring|growth rings]] that can be used to find the age of the tree and the temporal properties of its environment.

==Area and volume==

[[Cavalieri's principle]] states that solids with corresponding cross sections of equal areas have equal volumes.

The cross-sectional area (&lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt;) of an object when viewed from a particular angle is the total area of the orthographic projection of the object from that angle. For example, a cylinder of height ''h'' and radius ''r'' has &lt;math&gt;A' = \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt; when viewed along its central axis, and &lt;math&gt;A' = 2 rh&lt;/math&gt; when viewed from an orthogonal direction. A sphere of radius ''r'' has &lt;math&gt;A' = \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt; when viewed from any angle. More generically, &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated by evaluating the following surface integral:

: &lt;math&gt; A' = \iint \limits_\mathrm{top}  d\mathbf{A}  \cdot  \mathbf{\hat{r}}, &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector pointing along the viewing direction toward the viewer, &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a surface element with an outward-pointing normal, and the integral is taken only over the top-most surface, that part of the surface that is &quot;visible&quot; from the perspective of the viewer. For a [[convex body]], each ray through the object from the viewer's perspective crosses just two surfaces. For such objects, the integral may be taken over the entire surface (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) by taking the absolute value of the integrand (so that the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; of the object do not subtract away, as would be required by the [[Divergence Theorem]] applied to the constant vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt;) and dividing by two:

: &lt;math&gt; A' = \frac{1}{2} \iint \limits_A  | d\mathbf{A}  \cdot  \mathbf{\hat{r}}| &lt;/math&gt;

== Cross section of four-dimensional space==

If a [[four dimensional space|four-dimensional object]] passed through our three-dimensional space, we would see a three-dimensional cross-section of the four-dimensional object, such as a sphere that increased and then decreased in apparent size during the encounter.

The rule is alluded to by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (bk V, ch. 10) as a metaphor for the importance of flexibility in [[Equity (law)|equitable justice]]: &quot;For what is itself indefinite can only be measured by an indefinite standard, like the leaden rule used by [[Lesbos|Lesbian]] builders; just as that rule is not rigid but can be bent to the shape of the stone, so a special ordinance is made to fit the circumstances of the case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aristotle |title=Nicomachean Ethics, Book 5 Chapter 10 |editor-first=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8132">In [[geometry]] and in its applications to [[drawing]], a '''perspectivity''' is the formation of an image in a [[picture plane]] of a scene viewed from a fixed point.

==Graphics==
The science of [[graphical perspective]] uses perspectivities to make realistic images in proper proportion. According to [[Kirsti Andersen]], the first author to describe perspectivity was [[Leon Alberti]] in his ''De Pictura'' (1435).&lt;ref&gt;[[Kirsti Andersen]] (2007) The Geometry of an Art, page 1,Springer ISBN 978-0-387-25961-1&lt;/ref&gt; In English, [[Brook Taylor]] presented his ''Linear Perspective'' in 1715, where he explained &quot;Perspective is the Art of drawing on a Plane the Appearances of any Figures, by the Rules of Geometry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersen|1992|loc=p. 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second book, ''New Principles of Linear Perspective'' (1719), Taylor wrote
:When Lines drawn according to a certain Law from the several Parts of any Figure, cut a Plane, and by that Cutting or Intersection describe a figure on that Plane, that Figure so described is called the ''Projection'' of the other Figure. The Lines producing that Projection, taken all together, are called the ''System of Rays''. And when those Rays all pass thro’ one and same Point, they are called the ''Cone of Rays''. And when that Point is consider’d as the Eye of a Spectator, that System of Rays is called the ''Optic Cone''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersen|1992|loc=p. 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projective Geometry==
[[File:projection geometry.svg|200px|thumb|A perspectivity:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;ABCD \doublebarwedge A'B'C'D',&lt;/math&gt;]]

In [[projective geometry]] the points of a line are called a [[projective range]], and the set of lines in a plane on a point is called a [[pencil (mathematics)|pencil]].

Given two [[line (geometry)|lines]] &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; in a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] and a point ''P'' of that plane on neither line, the [[bijection|bijective mapping]] between the points of the range of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and the range of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; determined by the lines of the pencil on ''P'' is called a '''perspectivity''' (or more precisely, a ''central perspectivity'' with center ''P'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coxeter|1969|loc=p. 242}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special symbol has been used to show that points ''X'' and ''Y'' are related by a perspectivity; &lt;math&gt;X \doublebarwedge Y .&lt;/math&gt; In this notation, to show that the center of perspectivity is ''P'', write &lt;math&gt;X \ \overset {P}{\doublebarwedge} \ Y.&lt;/math&gt; Using the language of functions, a central perspectivity with center ''P'' is a function &lt;math&gt;f_P \colon [\ell] \mapsto [m]&lt;/math&gt; (where the square brackets indicate the projective range of the line) defined by &lt;math&gt;f_P (X) = Y \text{ whenever } P \in XY&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=p. 281}}&lt;/ref&gt; This map is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], that is, &lt;math&gt;f_P (f_P (X)) = X \text{ for all }X \in [\ell]&lt;/math&gt;.

The existence of a perspectivity means that corresponding points are in [[perspective (geometry)|perspective]]. The [[duality (projective geometry)|dual]] concept, ''axial perspectivity'', is the correspondence between the lines of two pencils determined by a projective range.

===Projectivity===
The composition of two perspectivities is, in general, not a perspectivity. A perspectivity or a composition of two or more perspectivities is called a '''projectivity''' (''projective transformation'', ''projective collineation'' and ''[[homography]]'' are [[synonym]]s).

There are several results concerning projectivities and perspectivities which hold in any [[pappus's hexagon theorem|pappian]] projective plane:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fishback|1969|loc=pp. 65-66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorem: Any projectivity between two distinct projective ranges can be written as the composition of no more than two perspectivities.

Theorem: Any projectivity from a projective range to itself can be written as the composition of three perspectivities.

Theorem: A projectivity between two distinct projective ranges which fixes a point is a perspectivity.

===Higher-dimensional perspectivities===
The bijective correspondence between points on two lines in a plane determined by a point of that plane not on either line has higher-dimensional analogues which will also be called perspectivities.

Let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be two distinct ''m''-dimensional projective spaces contained in an ''n''-dimensional projective space ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt; be an (''n'' − ''m'' − 1)-dimensional subspace of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with no points in common with either ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. For each point ''X'' of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the space ''L'' spanned by ''X'' and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-''m''-1&lt;/sub&gt; meets ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; in a point {{nowrap|1=''Y'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')}}. This correspondence ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; is also called a perspectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedoe|1988|loc=pp. 282–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central perspectivity described above is the case with {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} and {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 1}}.

===Perspective collineations===
Let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two distinct projective planes in a projective 3-space ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. With ''O'' and ''O''* being points of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in neither plane, use the construction of the last section to project ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the perspectivity with center ''O'' followed by the projection of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; back onto ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the perspectivity with center ''O''*. This composition is a [[bijection|bijective map]] of the points of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto itself which preserves [[collinear]] points and is called a ''perspective collineation'' (''central collineation'' in more modern terminology).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1930|loc=p. 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let φ be a perspective collineation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Each point of the line of intersection of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be fixed by φ and this line is called the ''axis'' of φ. Let point ''P'' be the intersection of line ''OO''* with the plane ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. ''P'' is also fixed by φ and every line of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through ''P'' is stabilized by φ (fixed, but not necessarily pointwise fixed). ''P'' is called the ''center'' of φ. The restriction of φ to any line of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; not passing through ''P'' is the central perspectivity in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with center ''P'' between that line and the line which is its image under φ.

[[File:Latécoère 28.svg|thumb|320px|Three vijdpew plan of [[Latécoère 28]] for presentation purpose.]]
'''Plans''' are a set of  [[technical drawing|drawings]] or two-dimensional [[diagram]]s used to describe a [[Location (geography)|place]] or [[Object (philosophy)|object]], or to communicate [[building]] or [[Manufacturing|fabrication]] instructions. Usually plans are drawn or printed on paper, but they can take the form of a digital file.

These plans are used in a range of fields from [[architecture]], [[urban planning]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[industrial engineering]] to [[systems engineering]].

== Overview ==
Plans are often for [[Technology|technical]] purposes such as [[architecture]], [[engineering]], or [[urban planning|planning]]. Their purpose in these disciplines is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a site, building, product or component. Plans can also be for presentation or orientation purposes, and as such are often less detailed versions of the former. The end goal of plans is either to portray an existing place or object, or to convey enough information to allow a builder or manufacturer to realize a design.

The term &quot;plan&quot; may casually be used to refer to a single view, sheet, or drawing in a set of plans. More specifically a [[plan view]] is an [[orthographic projection]] looking down on the object, such as in a [[floor plan]].

The process of producing plans, and the skill of producing them, is often referred to as [[technical drawing]]. A working drawing is a type of technical drawing, which is part of the documentation needed to build an [[engineering]] product or [[architecture]]. Typically in architecture these could include [[civil drawing]]s, [[architectural drawing]]s, [[structural drawing]]s, [[mechanical drawing]]s, [[electrical drawing]]s, and [[plumbing drawing]]s. In engineering, these drawings show all necessary data to [[manufacture]] a given object, such as [[dimension]]s and [[angle]]s.

== Plan features ==

=== Format ===
Plans are often prepared in a &quot;set&quot;. The set includes all the information required for the purpose of the set, and may exclude views or projections which are unnecessary. A set of plans can be on standard office-sized paper or on large sheets. It can be stapled, folded or rolled as required. A set of plans can also take the form of a digital file in a proprietary format such as [[DWG]] or an exchange file format such as [[DXF]] or [[PDF]].

Plans are often referred to as &quot;[[blueprint]]s&quot; or &quot;[[whiteprint|bluelines]]&quot;. However, the terms are rapidly becoming an [[anachronism]], since these copying methods have mostly been superseded by reproduction processes that yield black or multicolour lines on white paper, or by electronic representations of information.

=== Scale ===
{{Main|Architect's scale|Engineer's scale|Metric scale}}
[[Image:Axonometric projections.png|thumb|The three [[Axonometric projection|axonometric views]].]]
Plans are usually &quot;scale drawings&quot;, meaning that the plans are drawn at a specific [[ratio]] relative to the actual size of the place or object. Various scales may be used for different drawings in a set. For example, a floor plan may be drawn at 1:48 (or 1/4&quot;=1'-0&quot;) whereas a detailed view may be drawn at 1:24 (or 1/2&quot;=1'-0&quot;). Site plans are often drawn at 1&quot; = 20' (1:240) or 1&quot; = 30' (1:360).

In the [[metric system]] the ratios commonly are 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:2000 and 1:5000

=== Views and projections ===
[[Image:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|left|200px|Symbols used to define whether a projection is either Third Angle (right) or First Angle (left).]]
Because plans represent three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane, the use of [[Graphical projection|views]] or [[Graphical projection|projections]] is crucial to the legibility of plans. Each projection is achieved by assuming a vantage point from which to see the place or object, and a type of projection. These projection types are:

*[[Parallel projection]]
**[[Orthographic projection]], including:
***Plan view or floor plan view
***[[Elevation (view)|Elevation]], usually a side view of an exterior
***[[Cross section (geometry)|Section]], a view of the interior at a particular cutting plane
**[[Axonometric projection]], including:
***[[Isometric projection]]
***[[Dimetric projection]]
***[[Trimetric projection]]
**[[Oblique projection]], and
*[[Perspective projection]]

=== Planning approach ===
There is no universal standard for sheet order, however the following describes a common approach:

* General Information : The first sheets in a set may include notes, assembly descriptions, a rendering of the project, or simply the project title.
* Site : [[Site plan]]s, including a key plan, appear before other plans and on smaller projects may be on the first sheet. A project could require a [[landscape plan]], although this can be integrated with the site plan if the drawing remains clear.
* Specific plans : [[Floor plan]]s, starting with the lowest floor and ending with the roof plan usually appear near the beginning of the set. Further, for example, reflected Ceiling Plans (RCP)s showing ceiling layouts appear after the floor plans.
* [[Elevation (view)|Elevation]]s : Starting with the principal, or front elevation, all the building elevations appear after the plans. Smaller residential projects may display the elevations before the plans. Elevation details may appear on the same sheets as the building elevations.
* [[Cross section (geometry)|Section]]s: Building sections that describe views cut through the entire building appear next, followed by wall sections, then detail sections.
* Details: Details may appear on any of the previous sheets, or may be collected to appear on detail sheets. These details may include construction details that show how the components of the building fit together. These details may also include [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] drawings or other interior details.
* Schedules: Many aspects of a building must be listed as schedules on larger projects. These include schedules for windows, doors, wall or floor finishes, hardware, landscaping elements, rooms, and areas.

Where additional systems are complex and require many details for installation, specialized additional plan drawings may be used, such as:
* [[Structural drawing|Structural]]: While smaller projects may only show structural information on the plans and sections, larger projects have separate sheets describing the structure of the building.
* [[Mechanical drawing|Mechanical]]: Mechanical drawings show plumbing, [[heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] systems, or fire protection systems.
* [[Electrical drawing|Electrical]] :Electrical plan drawings may include equipment and cable tray layout, lighting and power, [[ground (electrical)|grounding]], telephone, local area network, special communications or signal systems, or a reflected lighting plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3889">[[File:Schmidtnet.svg|thumb|right|Schmidt net, used for making plots of the Lambert azimuthal projection.]]
The '''Schmidt net''' is a manual drafting method for the [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection]] using graph paper. It results in one lateral hemisphere of the Earth with the grid of [[circle of latitude|parallels]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]s. The method is common in the geophysical sciences.

==Construction==
In the figure, the area-preserving property of the projection can be seen by comparing a grid sector near the center of the net with one at the far right of the net. The two sectors have the same area on the sphere and the same area on the disk. The angle-distorting property can be seen by examining the grid lines; most of them do not intersect at right angles on the Schmidt net. A single Schmidt net can only represent one hemisphere of the earth; typically a pair of Schmidt nets is used to represent both sides of the globe.

It is relatively simple to re-plot a gridded map of the world onto a Schmidt net if the azimuth is chosen to be the junction of the equator with any particular meridian from the world-map's grid.  Each grid square surrounding this chosen longitude is simply re-plotted into the corresponding distorted grid-square in the Schmidt net.  Points of latitude-longitude can be plotted relative to the azimuth's longitude, interpolating between grid lines in the Schmidt net.  For greater accuracy it is helpful to have a net with finer spacing than 10°; spacings of 2° are common.

[[File:Schmidtnetanimation.gif|thumb|left|Animation demonstrating the alternative use of a Schmidt net to produce a Lambert equal-area projection using a polar azimuth.]]
The Schmidt net is not an appropriate grid for representing the Earth's northern or southern hemisphere (because the lines would not correspond to meridians or parallels in such a projection).  However it can be used as a scalar measuring device for projecting latitude-longitude points onto a blank circle of the same size, to produce a Lambert equal-area projection with the azimuth at the north or south pole.  The intersection of the parallels with the outer circle can be used as a de facto protractor for plotting a point's longitude as the angle in the polar projection.  The Schmidt net's horizontal axis can then be used as a scalar measuring device to convert the point's latitude (relative to the pole) into a radial distance from the centre of the circle.  Alternatively, the Schmidt net could be replaced entirely with a correctly projected polar grid, and grid squares from a map re-drawn into this disc.

==Use==
Researchers in [[structural geology]] use the Lambert azimuthal projection to plot [[Lineation (geology)|lineation]] and [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]] in rocks, [[slickenside]]s in [[Fault (geology)|faults]], and other linear and planar features. In this context the projection is called the '''equal-area hemispherical projection'''. The Schmidt net is often used to sketch out the Lambert azimuthal projection for these purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;borradaile2003&quot;&gt;Borradaile (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the [[Stereographic_projection#Wulff_net|Wulff net]] (&quot;equal-angle projection&quot;) is used to plot [[crystallography|crystallographic]] axes and faces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3831">'''Drafting film''' is a sturdier and more dimensionally stable substitute for [[Vellum#Paper vellum|drafting paper]] sometimes used for [[technical drawings]], especially [[architectural drawings]], and for [[Artwork (graphic arts)|art layout drawings]], replacing [[drafting linen]] for these purposes. Nowadays it is almost invariably made of transparent [[BoPET|biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate]], which should last several centuries under normal storage conditions, with one or two translucent matte surfaces provided by a coating.  However, some older drafting films are [[cellulose acetate]], which degrades in only a few decades due to the [[vinegar syndrome]].  Uncoated films are preferred for [[Preservation_(library_and_archival_science)|archival]], because there is then no possibility that the coating material could deteriorate over time or react with other materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-12.html Transparent drafting films: profiles for preservation, Susan Page, Presented at the Book and Paper specialty group poster session, AIC 24th Annual Meeting, June 10-16, 1996, Norfolk Virginia.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Uncoated films require the use of an etching ink that penetrates the surface of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=YiY9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=drafting+film&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HxSGU9fXObSmsAS2kICYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=drafting&amp;f=false Archaeological Illustration, 1989, Lesley Adkins, Roy A. Adkins, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because non-etching ink doesn't penetrate the surface of the film the way it penetrates paper, it is often possible to remove inked lines from drafting film when drawing on it by hand; an abrasive-free [[Eraser#Soft_vinyl_erasers|vinyl drafting eraser]] is the preferred tool for this,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=QbdMOM89qv0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=drafting+film&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HxSGU9fXObSmsAS2kICYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=drafting%20film&amp;f=false Architectural Drafting and Design, Fifth Edition, Alan Jefferis, David A. Madsen, 2005, p.31]&lt;/ref&gt; although a [[scalpel]] works too.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins and Adkins, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, graphite on the surface tends to smear; there are polyester pencil drafting leads available as a substitute for [[graphite]] for drawing on drafting film.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferis &amp; Madsen, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Different matte coatings (generally consisting of amorphous silica particles dispersed in a resin) are better suited for graphite or for polyester leads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=qv_Nx3HavOkC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=drafting+film&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HxSGU9fXObSmsAS2kICYDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=drafting%20film&amp;f=false Handbook of Imaging Materials, Second Edition, CRC Press, Arthur S. Diamond &amp; David S. Weiss, 2002, p. 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

Manual drawing on drafting film requires special care with cleanliness, because [[Sebum|oil]] from the illustrator's hands can form skid patches on the film's nonporous surface, where ink and pencil will not adhere to the matte surface, while drafting paper will absorb the oil.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins &amp; Adkins, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional stability is important for scale drawings that don't have explicit dimensions, such as maps, because measurements may be taken directly from the drawing, so drawings that expand and shrink with temperature and humidity can introduce great imprecision into these measurements; some undimensioned drawing standards require the use of drafting film for such drawings.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2008, &quot;Undimensioned Drawings&quot;, [[ASME Y14.31-2008]], ¶4, &quot;Drawings that require strength, durability, and dimensional stability shall be prepared on Class 1 polyester film...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LaBelle Blueprint.jpg|frame|right|Modern blueprint of the French galleon ''[[La Belle (ship)|La Belle]]'']]
[[File:Waldhaus Gasterntal Plan5.JPG|thumb|Architectural drawing, 1902]]
[[File:Joy Oil gas station blueprints.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Architectural drawing, Canada, 1936]]

A '''blueprint''' is a reproduction of a [[technical drawing]], documenting an [[architecture]] or an [[engineering]] design, using a [[contact print]] process on light-sensitive sheets. Introduced in the 19th century, the process allowed rapid and accurate reproduction of documents used in construction and industry. The blue-print process was characterized by light colored lines on a blue background, a [[Negative (photography)|negative]] of the original. The process was unable to reproduce color or shades of grey. 
  
Various base materials have been used for blueprints.  Paper was a common choice; for more durable prints [[linen]] was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly.  To combat this problem, printing on [[vellum#Paper_vellum|imitation vellum]] and, later, polyester film ([[Mylar]]) was implemented.

The process has been largely displaced by the diazo [[whiteprint]] process and by large-format [[xerography|xerographic]] photocopiers, so reproduced drawings are usually called &quot;prints&quot; or just &quot;drawings&quot;.

The term ''[[wikt:blueprint|blueprint]]'' is also used less formally to refer to any [[floor plan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and even more informally, [[wikt:blueprint|any type of plan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blueprint?s=t |title=Blueprint |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blueprint |title=Blueprint |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The blueprint  processes==
In 1861 Alphonse Louis Poitevin, a French [[chemist]], found that ferro-gallate in [[Gum arabic|gum]] is light sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.alternativephotography.com/wp/processes/historic-processes/forgotten-processes | title = Historic processes | publisher = Alternative photography | contribution = Forgotten processes}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Light turns this to an insoluble permanent blue. A coating of this chemical on a paper or other base may be used to reproduce an image from a [[translucent]] document.

The ferro-gallate is coated onto a paper from aqueous solution and dried. The coating is yellow. In darkness it is stable for up to three days. It is clamped under glass and a light transmitting document in a daylight exposure frame, which is similar to  a picture frame. The frame is put out into daylight requiring a minute or two under a bright sun or about ten times this under an overcast sky. Where [[ultra-violet light]] is transmitted the coating converts to a stable blue or black dye. The image can be seen forming, when a strong image is seen the frame is brought indoors and the unconverted coating, under the original image, is washed away. The paper is then dried.

The result is a copy of the original image with the clear background area rendered dark blue and the image reproduced as a white line. The image is stable. The contact printing process has the advantage that no large-field optical system is required. A further advantage is that the reproduced document will have the same [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] as the original. Another quality is that the dark blue background makes it difficult to add new information to the print (such as recording as-built changes); a blueprint cannot easily be altered—depending on the situation, this can be either a strength or a drawback. Since the paper is soaked in liquid during processing, a minor change of scale can occur, and the paper can also become brittle. Engineering drawings often are marked to remind users not to rely on the scale of reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph W. Liebing ''Architectural Working Drawings'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999 ISBN 0471348767 page 576&lt;/ref&gt;

Other blueprint processes based on photosensitive ferric compounds have been used. The best known is probably a process using ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/work/blue.htm | title = Blue | publisher = PSLC | place = WS}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this procedure a distinctly blue compound is formed and the process is also known as [[cyanotype]]. The paper is impregnated with a solution of ammonium ferric citrate and dried. When the paper is illuminated a photoreaction turns the trivalent (ferric) iron into divalent (ferrous) iron. The image is then developed using a solution of potassium ferricyanide forming insoluble ferroferricyanide ([[Prussian blue|Turnbell's blue]] identical to [[Prussian blue]]) with the divalent iron. Excess ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide are then washed away.

This is a simple process for the reproduction of any light transmitting document. [[Engineer]]s and [[architect]]s drew their designs on [[cartridge paper]]; these were then traced on to [[tracing paper]] using [[India ink|Indian ink]] for reproduction whenever needed.

Introduction of the blueprint process eliminated the expense of photolithographic reproduction or of hand-tracing of original drawings. By the latter 1890s in American architectural offices, a blueprint was one-tenth the cost of a hand-traced reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Mary N. Woods ''From Craft to Profession: The Practice of Architecture in Nineteenth-Century America'' University of California Press, 1999 ISBN 0520214943, page 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; The blueprint process is still used for special artistic and photographic effects, on paper and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fabbri, Malin Fabbri ''Blueprint to Cyanotypes - Exploring a Historical Alternative Photographic Process''Lulu.com, 2006 ISBN 141169838X page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blueprints replaced by whiteprints==
[[File:Heliographic_copy.jpg|thumb|Whiteprint plan copy.]]
Traditional blueprints have largely been replaced by more modern, less expensive printing methods and digital displays. In the early 1940s, cyanotype blueprint began to be supplanted by diazo prints, also known as [[whiteprint]]s, which have blue lines on a white background; thus these drawings are also called ''blue-lines'' or bluelines.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642801/whiteprint Blueprints replaced by whiteprints]&lt;/ref&gt; Other comparable dye-based prints are known as blacklines.

Diazo prints remain in use in some applications{{where|date=November 2013}} but in many cases have been replaced by [[Xerography|xerographic]] print processes similar to standard copy machine technology using [[toner]] on [[bond paper]]. More recently, designs created using [[computer-aided design]] techniques may be transferred as a digital file directly to a [[computer printer]] or [[plotter]]; in some applications paper is avoided altogether and work and analysis is done directly from [[digital display]]s. Another common modern method of copying is the use of large-format [[Image scanner|scanners]]. These digitize an image which can then be printed with a large-format [[plotter]].

As display technologies have advanced, the use of mobile devices, like the [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-powered tablets, for viewing plans has increased significantly among modern construction firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Michael|title=Crain Construction grows its 80-year-old business with iOS, Android tablets|url=http://tabtimes.com/case-studies/mobile-workers/2013/03/25/crain-construction-grows-its-80-year-old-business-ios-android|publisher=tabtimes.com|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Software from companies like [[PlanGrid]], [[Bluebeam Software, Inc.|Bluebeam]], [[Fieldwire]], Okitoo, and others specialize in viewing these high-resolution PDF files and sharing notes easily between tablet users.

The traditional term &quot;blueprint&quot; has continued to be used informally (usually by non-expert commentators) to refer to each type of image.  Practicing engineers, architects and drafters just call them &quot;drawings&quot; or &quot;prints&quot;.{{citation needed|reason=Unsubstantiated statement, flies directly in the face of first-hand real-life experience.|date=January 2016}}

{{Views}}
'''Perspective''' (from {{lang-la|perspicere}} to see through) in the [[graphic arts]] is an approximate representation, on a flat surface (such as paper), of an image as it is seen by the eye. The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are smaller as their distance from the observer increases; and that they are subject to ''foreshortening'', meaning that an object's dimensions along the line of sight are shorter than its dimensions across the line of sight.

[[Italian Renaissance]] painters and architects including [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Masaccio]], [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Luca Pacioli]] studied linear perspective, wrote treatises on it, and incorporated it into their artworks, thus contributing to the [[Mathematics and art|mathematics of art]].

== Overview ==
[[File:Perspectiva-1.svg|thumb|A cube in two-point perspective]]
[[File:Perspectiva-2.svg|thumb|Rays of light travel from the object, through the picture plane, and to the viewer's eye. This is the basis for graphical perspective.]]

Linear perspective always works by representing the light that passes from a scene through an imaginary rectangle (realized as the plane of the painting), to the viewer's eye, as if a viewer were looking through a window and painting what is seen directly onto the windowpane. If viewed from the same spot as the windowpane was painted, the painted image would be identical to what was seen through the unpainted window. Each painted object in the scene is thus a flat, scaled down version of the object on the other side of the window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Perspective Drawing Handbook |author=D'Amelio, Joseph |page=19 |publisher=Dover |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each portion of the painted object lies on the straight line from the viewer's eye to the equivalent portion of the real object it represents, the viewer sees no difference (sans [[depth perception]]) between the painted scene on the windowpane and the view of the real scene.
All perspective drawings assume the viewer is a certain distance away from the drawing. Objects are scaled relative to that viewer. An object is often not scaled evenly: a circle often appears as an ellipse and a square can appear as a trapezoid.  This distortion is referred to as foreshortening.

Perspective drawings have a horizon line, which is often implied. This line, directly opposite the viewer's eye, represents objects infinitely far away. They have shrunk, in the distance, to the infinitesimal thickness of a line. It is analogous to (and named after) the Earth's [[horizon]].

Any perspective representation of a scene that includes parallel lines has one or more [[vanishing point]]s in a perspective drawing. A one-point perspective drawing means that the drawing has a single vanishing point, usually (though not necessarily) directly opposite the viewer's eye and usually (though not necessarily) on the horizon line. All lines parallel with the viewer's line of sight recede to the horizon towards this vanishing point. This is the standard &quot;receding railroad tracks&quot; phenomenon. A two-point drawing would have lines parallel to two different angles. Any number of vanishing points are possible in a drawing, one for each set of parallel lines that are at an angle relative to the plane of the drawing.

Perspectives consisting of many parallel lines are observed most often when drawing architecture (architecture frequently uses lines parallel to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|x, y, and z axes]]). Because it is rare to have a scene consisting solely of lines parallel to the three Cartesian axes (x, y, and z), it is rare to see perspectives in practice with only one, two, or three vanishing points; even a simple house frequently has a peaked roof which results in a minimum of six sets of parallel lines, in turn corresponding to up to six vanishing points.

In contrast, natural scenes often do not have any sets of parallel lines and thus no vanishing points.

=== Early history ===
The earliest art paintings and drawings typically sized many objects and characters hierarchically according to their spiritual or thematic importance, not their distance from the viewer, and did not use [[foreshortening]]. The most important figures are often shown as the highest in a composition, also from [[hieratic]] motives, leading to the so-called &quot;vertical perspective&quot;, common in the [[art of Ancient Egypt]], where a group of &quot;nearer&quot; figures are shown below the larger figure or figures. The only method to indicate the relative position of elements in the composition was by overlapping, of which much use is made in works like the [[Parthenon Marbles]].

=== History ===

[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|15th century illustration from the [[Old French]] translation of [[William of Tyre]]'s ''Histoire d'Outremer''.{{efn|There is clearly a general attempt to reduce the size of more distant elements, but unsystematically. Sections of the composition are at a similar scale, with relative distance shown by overlapping, [[foreshortening]], and further objects being higher than nearer ones, though the workmen at left do show finer adjustment of size. But this is abandoned on the right where the most important figure is much larger than the mason. Rectangular buildings and the blocks of stone are shown obliquely.}}]]

[[File:Song Dynasty Hydraulic Mill for Grain.JPG|thumb|left|A Song Dynasty watercolor painting of a mill in an [[oblique projection|oblique perspective]], 12th century]]
Chinese artists made use of [[oblique projection|oblique perspective]] from the first or second century until the 18th century. It is not certain how they came to use the technique; some authorities suggest that the Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome.&lt;ref name=Cucker269/&gt; Oblique projection is also seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269/&gt; In the 18th century, Chinese artists began to combine oblique perspective with regular diminution of size of people and objects with distance; no particular vantage point is chosen, but a convincing effect is achieved.&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278 | quote=Dubery and Willats (1983:33) write that 'Oblique projection seems to have arrived in China from Rome by way of India round about the first or second century AD.'}} Figure 10.9 [Wen-Chi returns home, anon, China, 12th century] shows an archetype of the classical use of oblique perspective in Chinese painting.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic attempts to evolve a system of perspective are usually considered to have begun around the fifth century BC in the [[art of Ancient Greece]], as part of a developing interest in [[illusionism]] allied to theatrical scenery. This was detailed within [[Aristotle's Poetics]] as ''skenographia'': using flat panels on a stage to give the illusion of depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/tragedy/intr15.htm |title=Skenographia in Fifth Century |publisher=[[CUNY]] |accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophers [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Democritus]] worked out geometric theories of perspective for use with ''skenographia''. [[Alcibiades]] had paintings in his house designed using ''skenographia'', so this art was not confined merely to the stage. [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' introduced a mathematical theory of perspective, but there is some debate over the extent to which Euclid's perspective coincides with the modern mathematical definition.

By the later periods of antiquity, artists, especially those in less popular traditions, were well aware that distant objects could be shown smaller than those close at hand for increased realism, but whether this convention was actually used in a work depended on many factors.
Some of the paintings found in the [[House of the Vettii|ruins of Pompeii]] show a remarkable realism and perspective for their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/AandL/Maecenas/italy_except_rome_and_sicily/pompeii/ac880907.html|title=Pompeii. House of the Vettii. Fauces and Priapus|publisher=[[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]]|accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that comprehensive systems of perspective were evolved in antiquity, but most scholars do not accept this. Hardly any of the many works where such a system would have been used have survived. A passage in [[Philostratus III|Philostratus]] suggests that classical artists and theorists thought in terms of &quot;circles&quot; at equal distance from the viewer, like a classical semi-circular theatre seen from the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Panofsky | first=Erwin | title=Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art | publisher=Almqvist &amp; Wiksell | location=Stockholm | year=1960 | isbn = 0-06-430026-9 | page=122, note 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof beams in rooms in the [[Vergilius Vaticanus|Vatican Virgil]], from about 400 AD, are shown converging, more or less, on a common vanishing point, but this is not systematically related to the rest of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:VaticanVergilFol040rDeathOfDido.jpg|Vatican Virgil image]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late Antique period use of perspective techniques declined. The art of the new cultures of the [[Migration Period]] had no tradition of attempting compositions of large numbers of figures and Early Medieval art was slow and inconsistent in relearning the convention from classical models, though the process can be seen underway in [[Carolingian art]].

[[File:StPaul'sCross.jpg|thumb|upright|Geometrically incorrect attempt at perspective in a 1614 painting of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]]. ([[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]])]]

Various paintings and drawings during the Middle Ages show amateur attempts at projections of furniture, where parallel lines are successfully represented in [[isometric projection]], or by non parallel ones, but without a single vanishing point.

Medieval artists in Europe, like those in the Islamic world and China, were aware of the general principle of varying the relative size of elements according to distance, but even more than classical art was perfectly ready to override it for other reasons. Buildings were often shown obliquely according to a particular convention. The use and sophistication of attempts to convey distance increased steadily during the period, but without a basis in a systematic theory. [[Byzantine art]] was also aware of these principles, but also had the [[reverse perspective]] convention for the setting of principal figures.

[[Giotto]] attempted drawings in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. One of Giotto's first uses of his algebraic method of perspective was ''[[:Image:Giotto - Scrovegni - -32- - Christ before Caiaphas.jpg|Jesus Before Caiaphas]]''. Although the picture does not conform to the modern, geometrical method of perspective, it does give a considerable illusion of depth, and was a large step forward in Western art.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

With the exception of dice, [[heraldry]] typically ignores perspective in the treatment of [[charge (heraldry)|charges]], though sometimes in later centuries these are specified as ''in perspective''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In about 1413 a contemporary of Ghiberti, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], demonstrated the geometrical method of perspective, used today by artists, by painting the outlines of various [[Florence|Florentine]] buildings onto a mirror. When the building's outline was continued, he noticed that all of the lines converged on the horizon line. According to [[Vasari]], he then set up a demonstration of his painting of the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery]] in the incomplete doorway of the [[Santa Maria del Fiore|Duomo]]. He had the viewer look through a small hole on the back of the painting, facing the Baptistery. He would then set up a mirror, facing the viewer, which reflected his painting. To the viewer, the painting of the Baptistery and the building itself were nearly indistinguishable.

Soon after, nearly every artist in Florence and in Italy used geometrical perspective in their paintings,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...and these works (of perspective by Brunelleschi) were the means of arousing the minds of the other craftsmen, who afterwords devoted themselves to this with great zeal.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Vasari's ''Lives of the Artists'' Chapter on Brunelleschi&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Masolino da Panicale]] and [[Donatello]]. Donatello started sculpting elaborate checkerboard floors into the simple [[manger]] portrayed in the birth of Christ. Although hardly historically accurate, these checkerboard floors obeyed the primary laws of geometrical perspective: the lines converged approximately to a vanishing point, and the rate at which the horizontal lines receded into the distance was graphically determined. This became an integral part of [[Quattrocento]] art. [[Melozzo da Forlì]] first used the technique of upward foreshortening (in Rome, [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]], [[Forlì]] and others), and was celebrated for that. Not only was perspective a way of showing depth, it was also a new method of [[Composition (visual arts)|composing]] a painting. Paintings began to show a single, unified scene, rather than a combination of several.

[[File:Loreto Fresko.jpg|thumb|[[Melozzo]]'s use of upward foreshortening in his [[fresco]]es at [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]]]]
[[File:Entrega de las llaves a San Pedro (Perugino).jpg|thumb|[[Pietro Perugino]]'s use of perspective in this [[fresco]] at the [[Sistine Chapel]] (1481–82) helped bring the [[Renaissance]] to Rome.]]

As shown by the quick proliferation of accurate perspective paintings in Florence, Brunelleschi likely understood (with help from his friend the mathematician [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli|Toscanelli]]),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Messer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, having returned from his studies, invited Filippo with other friends to supper in a garden, and the discourse falling on mathematical subjects, Filippo formed a friendship with him and learned geometry from him.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Vasarai's ''Lives of the Artists'', Chapter on Brunelleschi&lt;/ref&gt; but did not publish, the mathematics behind perspective. Decades later, his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] wrote ''[[De pictura]]'' (1435/1436), a treatise on proper methods of showing distance in painting. Alberti's primary breakthrough was not to show the mathematics in terms of conical projections, as it actually appears to the eye. Instead, he formulated the theory based on planar projections, or how the rays of light, passing from the viewer's eye to the landscape, would strike the picture plane (the painting). He was then able to calculate the apparent height of a distant object using two similar triangles. The mathematics behind similar triangles is relatively simple, having been long ago formulated by [[Euclid]]. In viewing a wall, for instance, the first triangle has a [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] at the user's eye, and vertices at the top and bottom of the wall. The bottom of this triangle is the distance from the viewer to the wall. The second, similar triangle, has a point at the viewer's eye, and has a length equal to the viewer's eye from the painting. The height of the second triangle can then be determined through a simple ratio, as proven by [[Euclid]]. Alberti was also trained in the science of optics through the school of Padua and under the influence of [[Biagio Pelacani da Parma]] who studied [[Alhazen]]'s ''[[Book of Optics]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=El-Bizri | first=Nader | authorlink=Nader El-Bizri | chapter=Classical Optics and the Perspectiva Traditions Leading to the Renaissance |  pages=11–30 | editor1-last=Hendrix | editor1-first=John Shannon | editor1link=John Shannon Hendrix | editor2-last=Carman | editor2-first=Charles H. | title=Renaissance Theories of Vision (Visual Culture in Early Modernity) | date=2010 | location=Farnham, Surrey | publisher=[[Ashgate]] | isbn=1-409400-24-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see what was noted above in this regard with respect to Ghiberti).

[[Piero della Francesca]] elaborated on Della Pittura in his ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]]'' in the 1470s. Alberti had limited himself to figures on the ground plane and giving an overall basis for perspective. Della Francesca fleshed it out, explicitly covering solids in any area of the picture plane. Della Francesca also started the now common practice of using illustrated figures to explain the mathematical concepts, making his treatise easier to understand than Alberti's. Della Francesca was also the first to accurately draw the [[Platonic solids]] as they would appear in perspective. [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 ''De divina proportione'' (''On Divine Proportion''), illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], summarized the use of perspective in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]] |author1=O'Connor, J. J. |author2=Robertson, E. F. |date=July 1999 |accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Perspective remained, for a while, the domain of Florence. [[Jan van Eyck]], among others, was unable to create a consistent structure for the converging lines in paintings, as in London's [[The Arnolfini Portrait]], because he was unaware of the theoretical breakthrough just then occurring in Italy. However he achieved very subtle effects by manipulations of scale in his interiors. Gradually, and partly through the movement of academies of the arts, the Italian techniques became part of the training of artists across Europe, and later other parts of the world.

The culmination of these Renaissance traditions finds its ultimate synthesis in the research of the 17th century architect, geometer, and optician [[Girard Desargues]] on perspective, optics and projective geometry. Further [[Projective geometry#History|advances in projective geometry]], in the 19th and 20th centuries, led to the development of [[analytic geometry]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Present : Computer graphics ===
3-D [[Personal computer game|computer games]] and [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-tracers]] often use a modified version of perspective. Like the painter, the computer program is generally not concerned with every ray of light that is in a scene. Instead, the program simulates rays of light traveling backwards from the monitor (one for every pixel), and checks to see what it hits. In this way, the program does not have to compute the trajectories of millions of rays of light that pass from a light source, hit an object, and miss the viewer. {{Dubious|date=June 2013}}

[[CAD]] software, and some computer games (especially games using 3-D polygons) use linear algebra, and in particular matrix multiplication, to create a sense of perspective. The scene is a set of points, and these points are projected to a plane (computer screen){{Dubious|date=June 2013}} in front of the view point (the viewer's eye). The problem of perspective is simply finding the corresponding coordinates on the plane corresponding to the points in the scene. By the theories of linear algebra, a matrix multiplication directly computes the desired coordinates, thus bypassing any [[descriptive geometry]] theorems used in perspective drawing. {{Dubious|date=June 2013}}.

== Types of perspective ==
Of the many types of perspective drawings, the most common categorizations of artificial perspective are one-, two- and three-point. The names of these categories refer to the number of [[vanishing point]]s in the perspective drawing.

=== One-point perspective ===
[[File:Perspective-1point.svg|thumbnail|100px|One-point perspective]]
A drawing has one-point perspective when it contains only one vanishing point on the horizon line. This type of perspective is typically used for images of roads, railway tracks, hallways, or buildings viewed so that the front is directly facing the viewer. Any objects that are made up of lines either directly parallel with the viewer's line of sight or directly perpendicular (the railroad slats) can be represented with one-point perspective. These parallel lines converge at the vanishing point.

One-point perspective exists when the [[picture plane]] is parallel to two axes of a rectilinear (or Cartesian) scene – a scene which is composed entirely of linear elements that intersect only at right angles. If one axis is parallel with the picture plane, then all elements are either parallel to the picture plane (either horizontally or vertically) or perpendicular to it. All elements that are parallel to the picture plane are drawn as parallel lines. All elements that are perpendicular to the picture plane converge at a single point (a vanishing point) on the horizon.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Two-point perspective ===
[[File:Perspective-2point.svg|thumbnail|right|100px|Two-Point Perspective]]
[[File:Perspective1.jpg|right|thumb|210x210px|A cube drawing using 2-point perspective]]
A drawing has two-point perspective when it contains two [[vanishing point]]s on the horizon line. In an illustration, these vanishing points can be placed arbitrarily along the horizon. Two-point perspective can be used to draw the same objects as one-point perspective, rotated: looking at the corner of a house, or at two forked roads shrinking into the distance, for example. One point represents one set of [[parallel lines]], the other point represents the other. Seen from the corner, one wall of a house would recede towards one vanishing point while the other wall recedes towards the opposite vanishing point.

Two-point perspective exists when the painting plate is parallel to a [[Cartesian scene]] in one axis (usually the [[z-axis]]) but not to the other two axes. If the scene being viewed consists solely of a cylinder sitting on a horizontal plane, no difference exists in the image of the cylinder between a one-point and two-point perspective.

Two-point perspective has one set of lines parallel to the picture plane and two sets oblique to it. Parallel lines oblique to the picture plane converge to a vanishing point, which means that this set-up will require two vanishing points.
[[File:2-pt-sketchup.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Walls in 2-point perspective, converging toward two vanishing points. All vertical elements are parallel. Model from 3D Warehouse, rendered in SketchUp.]]
{{clear}}

=== Three-point perspective ===
[[File:Perspective-3point.svg|thumbnail|100px|Three-Point Perspective]]

Three-point perspective is often used for buildings seen from above (or below). In addition to the two vanishing points from before, one for each wall, there is now one for how the vertical lines of the walls recede. For an object seen from above, this third vanishing point is below the ground. For an object seen from below, as when the viewer looks up at a tall building, the third vanishing point is high in space.

Three-point perspective exists when the perspective is a view of a Cartesian scene where the picture plane is not parallel to any of the scene's three axes. Each of the three vanishing points corresponds with one of the three axes of the scene.
One, two and three-point perspectives appear to embody different forms of calculated perspective, and are generated by different methods. Mathematically, however, all three are identical; the difference is merely in the relative orientation of the rectilinear scene to the viewer.

All three axes are oblique to the picture plane; the three vanishing points are at the zenith, and on the horizon to the right and left.]]
{{clear}}

=== Four-point perspective ===
Four-point perspective, also called infinite-point perspective, is the curvilinear (see [[curvilinear perspective]]) variant of two-point perspective. A four-point perspective image can represent a 360° panorama, and even beyond 360° to depict impossible scenes. This perspective can be used with either a horizontal or a vertical horizon line: in the latter configuration it can depict both a [[worm's-eye view|worm's-eye]] and [[bird's-eye view]] of a scene at the same time.

Like all other foreshortened variants of perspective (one-point to six-point perspectives), it starts off with a horizon line, followed by four equally spaced vanishing points to delineate four vertical lines. The vanishing points made to create the curvilinear orthogonals are thus made ad hoc on the four vertical lines placed on the opposite side of the horizon line. The only dimension not foreshortened in this type of perspective is that of the rectilinear and parallel lines perpendicular to the horizon line – similar to the vertical lines used in two-point perspective.

One-point, two-point, and three-point perspective are dependent on the structure of the scene being viewed. These only exist for strict Cartesian (rectilinear) scenes. By inserting into a Cartesian scene a set of parallel lines that are not parallel to any of the three axes of the scene, a new distinct vanishing point is created. Therefore, it is possible to have an infinite-point perspective if the scene being viewed is not a Cartesian scene but instead consists of infinite pairs of parallel lines, where each pair is not parallel to any other pair.

=== Zero-point perspective ===
Because vanishing points exist only when parallel lines are present in the scene, a perspective with no vanishing points (&quot;zero-point&quot; perspective) occurs if the viewer is observing a non-linear scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basant|first=Agrawal|title=Engineering Drawing|year=2008|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-07-066863-8|page=17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common example of a nonlinear scene is a natural scene (e.g., a mountain range) which frequently does not contain any parallel lines. A perspective without vanishing points can still create a sense of depth. A zero-point perspective view is equivalent to an [[Elevation (view)|elevation]].

Foreshortening is the [[visual effect]] or [[optical illusion]] that causes an object or [[distance]] to appear shorter than it actually is because it is [[angle]]d toward the viewer. Additionally, an object is often not scaled evenly: a circle often appears as an ellipse and a square can appear as a trapezoid.

Although foreshortening is an important element in art where [[visual]] perspective is being depicted, foreshortening occurs in other types of two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional scenes. Some other types where foreshortening can occur include [[oblique projection|oblique parallel projection]] drawings. Foreshortening also occurs when imaging rugged terrain using a [[synthetic aperture radar]] system.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In painting, foreshortening in the depiction of the human figure was perfected in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and the ''[[Lamentation of Christ (Mantegna)|The Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]'' by [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1480s) is one of the most famous of a number of works that show off the new technique, which thereafter became a standard part of the training of artists.

== Methods of construction ==
Several methods of constructing perspectives exist, including:
* Freehand sketching (common in art)
* Graphically constructing (once common in architecture)
* Using a perspective grid
* Computing a [[perspective transform]] (common in 3D computer applications)
* Mimicry using tools such as a proportional divider (sometimes called a variscaler)
* Copying a photograph

== Example ==
[[File:Drawing Square in Perspective 2.svg|thumb|Rays of light travel from the object to the eye, intersecting with a notional picture plane.]]
[[File:Drawing Square in Perspective 1.svg|thumb|Determining the geometry of a square floor tile on the perspective drawing]]
One of the most common, and earliest, uses of geometrical perspective is a [[square tiling|checkerboard floor]]. It is a simple but striking application of one-point perspective. Many of the properties of perspective drawing are used while drawing a checkerboard. The checkerboard floor is, essentially, just a combination of a series of squares. Once a single square is drawn, it can be widened or subdivided into a checkerboard. Where necessary, lines and points will be referred to by their colors in the diagram.

To draw a square in perspective, the artist starts by drawing a horizon line (''black'') and determining where the vanishing point (''green'') should be. The higher up the horizon line is, the lower the viewer will appear to be looking, and vice versa. The more off-center the vanishing point, the more tilted the square will be. Because the square is made up of right angles, the vanishing point should be directly in the middle of the horizon line. A rotated square is drawn using two-point perspective, with each set of parallel lines leading to a different vanishing point.

The foremost edge of the (''orange'') square is drawn near the bottom of the painting. Because the viewer's picture plane is parallel to the bottom of the square, this line is horizontal. Lines connecting each side of the foremost edge to the vanishing point are drawn (in grey). These lines give the basic, one point &quot;railroad tracks&quot; perspective. The closer it is the horizon line, the farther away it is from the viewer, and the smaller it will appear. The farther away from the viewer it is, the closer it is to being perpendicular to the picture plane.

A new point (''the eye'') is now chosen, on the horizon line, either to the left or right of the vanishing point. The distance from this point to the vanishing point represents the distance of the viewer from the drawing. If this point is very far from the vanishing point, the square will appear squashed, and far away. If it is close, it will appear stretched out, as if it is very close to the viewer.

A line connecting this point to the opposite corner of the square is drawn. Where this (blue) line hits the side of the square, a horizontal line is drawn, representing the farthest edge of the square. The line just drawn represents the ray of light traveling from the farthest edge of the square to the viewer's eye. This step is key to understanding perspective drawing. The light that passes through the picture plane obviously can not be traced. Instead, lines that represent those rays of light are drawn on the picture plane. In the case of the square, the side of the square also represents the picture plane (at an angle), so there is a small shortcut: when the line hits the side of the square, it has also hit the appropriate spot in the picture plane.  The (''blue'') line is drawn to the opposite edge of the foremost edge because of another shortcut: since all sides are the same length, the foremost edge can stand in for the side edge.

Original formulations used, instead of the side of the square, a vertical line to one side, representing the picture plane. Each line drawn through this plane was identical to the line of sight from the viewer's eye to the drawing, only rotated around the y-axis ninety degrees. It is, conceptually, an easier way of thinking of perspective.  It can be easily shown that both methods are mathematically identical, and result in the same placement of the farthest side.

== Limitations ==
[[Plato]] was one of the first to discuss the problems of perspective.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Thus (through perspective) every sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic...
And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human understanding – there is the beauty of them – and the apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plato's Republic, Book X, 602d. http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/mirror/classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Hogarth-satire-on-false-pespective-1753.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Satire on False Perspective]]'' by [[William Hogarth]], 1753]]

Perspective images are calculated assuming a particular vanishing point. In order for the resulting image to appear identical to the original scene, a viewer of the perspective must view the image from the exact vantage point used in the calculations relative to the image. This cancels out what would appear to be distortions in the image when viewed from a different point. These apparent distortions are more pronounced away from the center of the image as the angle between a projected ray (from the scene to the eye) becomes more acute relative to the picture plane. In practice, unless the viewer chooses an extreme angle, like looking at it from the bottom corner of the window, the perspective normally looks more or less correct. This is referred to as &quot;Zeeman's Paradox.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mathographics by Robert Dixon New York: Dover, p. 82, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that a drawing in perspective still seems to be in perspective at other spots because we still perceive it as a drawing, because it lacks depth of field cues.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...the paradox is purely conceptual: it assumes we view a perspective representation as a retinal simulation, when in fact we view it as a two dimensional painting. In other words, perspective constructions create visual symbols, not visual illusions. The key is that paintings lack the depth of field cues created by binocular vision; we are always aware a painting is flat rather than deep. And that is how our mind interprets it, adjusting our understanding of the painting to compensate for our position.&quot;&lt;br&gt;http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html Retrieved on 25 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

For a typical perspective, however, the field of view is narrow enough (often only 60 degrees) that the distortions are similarly minimal enough that the image can be viewed from a point other than the actual calculated vantage point without appearing significantly distorted. When a larger angle of view is required, the standard method of projecting rays onto a flat picture plane becomes impractical. As a theoretical maximum, the field of view of a flat picture plane must be less than 180 degrees (as the field of view increases towards 180 degrees, the required breadth of the picture plane approaches infinity).

To create a projected ray image with a large field of view, one can project the image onto a curved surface.  To have a large field of view horizontally in the image, a surface that is a vertical cylinder (i.e., the axis of the cylinder is parallel to the z-axis) will suffice (similarly, if the desired large field of view is only in the vertical direction of the image, a horizontal cylinder will suffice). A cylindrical picture surface will allow for a projected ray image up to a full 360 degrees in either the horizontal or vertical dimension of the perspective image (depending on the orientation of the cylinder). In the same way, by using a spherical picture surface, the field of view can be a full 360 degrees in any direction (note that for a spherical surface, all projected rays from the scene to the eye intersect the surface at a right angle).

Just as a standard perspective image must be viewed from the calculated vantage point for the image to appear identical to the true scene, a projected image onto a cylinder or sphere must likewise be viewed from the calculated vantage point for it to be precisely identical to the original scene. If an image projected onto a cylindrical surface is &quot;unrolled&quot; into a flat image, different types of distortions occur. For example, many of the scene's straight lines will be drawn as curves. An image projected onto a spherical surface can be flattened in various ways:
* An image equivalent to an unrolled cylinder
* A portion of the sphere can be flattened into an image equivalent to a standard perspective
* An image similar to a fisheye photograph

A ''' heliographic copier''' or ''' heliographic duplicator'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Nations1937&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=League of Nations|title=Economic Committee: Sub-committee of Experts for the Unification of Customs Tariff Nomenclature. Draft Customs Nomenclature|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=9-XmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=heliographic+duplicator&amp;dq=heliographic+duplicator&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj70Y-e3urNAhXG0xQKHTkEDlEQ6AEIUTAI|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an apparatus used in the world of [[reprography]] for making contact prints on paper from original drawings made with that purpose on [[tracing paper]], [[parchment paper ]] or any other transparent or translucent material using different procedures. In general terms some type of ''heliographic copier'' is used for making: Hectographic prints, Ferrogallic prints, Gel-lithographs or Silver halide prints. All of them, until a certain size, can be achieved using a [[contact printer]] with an appropriate lamp (ultraviolet, etc..) but for big engineering and architectural plans, the ''heliographic copiers'' used with the [[cyanotype]] and the [[diazotype]] technologies, are of the roller type, which makes them completely different from [[contact printer]]s.

In the &quot;argot&quot; of engineers, architects and designers, the resulting plan copies coming from any type of '' heliographic copier'' no matter they were either blue or white, were traditionally called [[blueprint]]s, name derived from the blue background color of the [[cyanotype]] technique, which was the previous process for obtaining blueprints,  When the [[diazo]] based compounds changed the background color to white, in technical environments, -by tradition-, the name for copies of technical drawings remained [[Blueprint]] , although in English-speaking countries, it was intended, without much success, to change the name from '' [[Blueprint]] '' to '' [[Whiteprint]] ''. Using the right compound some &quot;cyano copiers&quot; could be adapted to be used as &quot;diazo copiers&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Taylor2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = David L. Taylor | title = Blueprint Reading for MachineTrades|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=EWE-RK3F6mcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Machine+Trades+Blueprint+Reading+David+L.+Taylor+the+term+blueprint+is+still+widely+used&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kh26VL7bKoHcUtW0g6gG&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Machine%20Trades%20Blueprint%20Reading%20David%20L.%20Taylor%20the%20term%20blueprint%20is%20still%20widely%20used&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Cengage Learning | isbn = 1-4018-9998-6 | pages = 3 -}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The light sensitivity of certain chemicals used in the cyanotype process, was already known when the English scientist and astronomer Sir [[John Herschel]] discovered the procedure in 1842 and several other related printing processes were patented by the 1890s .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/photography/process.php?processid=pr012&amp;row=2 |title=Exploring Photography – Photographic Processes – Cyanotype |website=V&amp;A|date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Herschel developed the process, he considered it mainly as a means of reproducing notes and diagrams, as its use in [[blueprints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vernacularphotography.com/vpm/v1n1/the_cyanotype.htm |title=The Cyanotype |website=Vernacular Photography|date=2012-12-12 |accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyano copier==
{{see also|Cyanotype|Blueprint}}
[[File:Joy Oil gas station blueprints.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Architectural drawing, Canada, 1936]]
This is a simple process for the reproduction of any light transmitting document. [[Engineer]]s and [[architect]]s used to draw their designs on [[cartridge paper]]; these were then traced by hand on to [[tracing paper]] using [[India ink|Indian ink]], which were kept to be reproduced with the ''cyano-copie''r whenever they were needed.

Introduction of the blueprint process eliminated the high expenses of photolithographic reproduction or of hand-tracing of original drawings. By the latter 1890s in American architectural offices, a blueprint was one-tenth the cost of a hand-traced reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Mary N. Woods ''From Craft to Profession: The Practice of Architecture in Nineteenth-Century America'' University of California Press, 1999 ISBN 0520214943, page 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; The blueprint process is still used for special artistic and photographic effects, on paper and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fabbri, Malin Fabbri ''Blueprint to Cyanotypes - Exploring a Historical Alternative Photographic Process''Lulu.com, 2006 ISBN 141169838X page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features ===
Different blueprint processes based on photosensitive ferric compounds have been used. The best known is probably a process using ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Blue|url=http://www.pslc.ws/macrog/work/blue.htm|place=WS|publisher=PSLC}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this procedure a distinctly blue compound is formed and the process is also known as [[cyanotype]]. The paper is impregnated with a solution of ammonium ferric citrate and dried. When the paper is illuminated a photoreaction turns the trivalent (ferric) iron into divalent (ferrous) iron. The image is then developed using a solution of potassium ferricyanide forming insoluble ferroferricyanide ([[Prussian blue|Turnbell's blue]] identical to [[Prussian blue]]) with the divalent iron. Excess ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide are then washed away.

==Diazo copier==
{{see also|Diazotype|Whiteprint}}
[[File:Heliographic copy.jpg|thumb | Diazo copies of drawings]]
The process of [[diazotype]] ([[Whiteprint|Whiteprints]]) replaced the  [[cyanotype]]  process ([[blueprint|blueprintts]]) for reproducing architectural and [[engineering drawing]]s because the process was simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueprinReplaced2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eva Zeisel|author2=Robert Sabella|title=Blueprints replaced by whiteprints|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Myz4kBTPTyQC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=Blueprints+replaced+by+whiteprints&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3bx52lOXy&amp;sig=COqWtnWs0wLzhJe9zOC7qYAb6zk&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEh7a0nOzNAhVIVhoKHT6hAPsQ6AEITjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Blueprints%20replaced%20by%20whiteprints&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Que Certification|isbn=978-0-7897-3504-1|pages=244–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A blue-line print is not permanent and will fade if exposed to light for weeks or months, but  a drawing print that lasts only a few months is sufficient for many purposes (test prints)

The different names ''blue-line copier'', ''[[whiteprint]] copier'' or '' diazo copier'',&lt;ref name=&quot;WijnekusWijnekus2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=VQghBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA844&amp;dq=copiadora+diazo&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h026VO3kAsH7UKvOg6gE&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=copiadora%20diazo&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of the Printing and Allied Industries: In Inglés (with definitions), French, German, Dutch, Spanish andItalian|date=22 October 2013|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-4832-8984-7|pages=844 -|author1=FJM Wijnekus|author2=E.F.P.H. Wijnekus}}&lt;/ref&gt; were given, due to the nature of the process, which consists in exposing to an [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] a previously sensitized paper with a component called [[diazo]], and finally developing it in a bath (a solution of ammonia in water) which converts the parts not exposed to light, to a dark blue colour (blue-line) over an almost white background.

=== Features ===
A little smell of ammonia and a faintly purplish paper colour are the main characteristics of a [[whiteprint]]. The dark lines in the original are converted to a dark violet colour, while the white parts degrade to a light purplish colour. The back of the drawings is a cream colour in which the folds are degraded to a lighter colour.

The diazo copies are of different sizes and for this reason the diazo paper is obtainable in standard sizes that vary from 30&amp;nbsp;cm to 60&amp;nbsp;cm wide, after de process the copied paper can be cut to the desired size.

The paper used for the diazo copies is usually a bond paper or similar type, with a diazo coating sensitive to the [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light.

==Operation ==

The original plan and the [[Photosensitive|sensitized paper]] , are introduced, in perfect contact, within the copier rollers that pull and expose them to a source of ultraviolet light, typically a [[blacklight]] lamp, similar to the manual action to expose both sheets strongly bonded directly to the sunlight, and once exposed:

*In the '' cyano copier'', the copied paper is immersed in a ''developer solution'' made from potassium ferricyanide and the it must be washed with water to eliminate the excess ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide. 
*In the '' diazo copier'', the paper is immersed in a ''developer solution'' made from ammonia (or ammonia vapor) converting the parts of the paper not exposed to the light source to a characteristic dark blue colour .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10665">A '''contact copier''' (also known as ''' contact printer'''), is a device used to copy an image by illuminating a film negative with the image in direct contact with a photosensitive surface (film, paper, plate, etc.). The more common processes are negative, where clear areas in the original produce an opaque or hardened photosensitive surface, but positive processes are available. The light source is usually an [[Actinic light|actínic]] bulb internal or external to the device&lt;ref name = &quot;Magazines1948&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cryder |first=George R. |title=Contact |magazine=Popular Mechanics |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=89gDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA216 |date=November 1948 |publisher=Hearst Magazines |pages=216- |issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial contact printers or [[process camera]]s usually use a pump-operated [[vacuum frame]] where the original and the photosensitive surface are pressed together against a flat glass by a grooved rubber mat connected to the vacuum source.  A timer-controlled [[mercury vapor]] ([[arc]] or [[fluorescent]]) light source is on the other side of the glass.&lt;ref name = &quot;Magazines1948&quot; /&gt;

== Uses ==
The contact copying process was used in the early days of [[photography]] and sunlight-exposed [[blueprint]]s; it is still used in amateur photography, silkscreen printing, offset printing, and [[photochemical machining]], such as the manufacture of [[Printed circuit board]]s.  By the early 20th century, blueprinting (producing white lines) or [[diazo]] [[whiteprint|blue line printing]] used contact-rollers rather than flat-glass exposure.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Silkscreen printing  and photochemical machining originally were based on [[gum bichromate]] photosensitive materials, where exposure to intense [[ultraviolet]] light made previously-soluble gum or gelatin [[colloids]] insoluble; after exposure, the exposed surface was washed in water and the unexposed coating dissolved, leaving the hardened gum or gelatin to [[resist]] the passage of the silk-screen ink or the metal-etching solution.  Offset printing can use either a negative plate, where the hardened, exposed photosensitive coating attracts ink and repels water, or a positive plate, where the exposed photosensitive coating decomposes or exposes the metal, water-attracting surface.

=== Photography===

The contact copier is used for duplication of'' negative or positive prints'' obtaining what are called ''contact prints'', that is, to reproduce on paper or film, a photographic negative ''or positive '' of exactly the same size of the original. (With normal photographic non inverting processes, ''black'' generates ''white'' on the target while ''white'' generates black). It was the common mode to make prints until it began the use of the alternative [[photographic enlarger]]. There are some models with internal light source constructed as a closed box, in which one or more lamps illuminate the negative through an opal or frosted [[glass]].

The reproduction is done by placing the negative on top of the glass and then the photo paper with the [[emulsion]] in contact with the negative. The negative role fits the body, the lid is closed applying some pressure against the glass to prevent blur; then proceed to impress photographic paper by turning on the interior light (contact copier) or an external focus, in the last case, usually from a [[photographic enlarger]]. Exposure time can be controlled &quot;manually&quot; or using a timer that controls the light source for a preset time and with greater precision.

===Whiteprint===
In the process of [[diazo copier|''whiteprint copying '']],&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueprinReplaced2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eva Zeisel|author2=Robert Sabella|title=Blueprints replaced by whiteprints|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=Myz4kBTPTyQC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=Blueprints+replaced+by+whiteprints&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3bx52lOXy&amp;sig=COqWtnWs0wLzhJe9zOC7qYAb6zk&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEh7a0nOzNAhVIVhoKHT6hAPsQ6AEITjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Blueprints%20replaced%20by%20whiteprints&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Que Certification|isbn=978-0-7897-3504-1|pages=244–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (essentially a [[diazotype]] process), a dynamic contact copier is used (similar to the manual action of exposing both sheets strongly bonded directly to the sunlight.). The exposition is made progressively as the twin rollers pull the two papers together (original and copy) against a source of ultraviolet light, typically a powerful [[black light]] lamp . The original plan (on a transparent support) and the diazo paper are introduced, in perfect contact, within the pinch rollers of the contact copier. The sensitized paper, has a [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]] coating -an impregnation of [[diazo]] - covering the surface of the paper. Once exposed, the copied paper is immersed in a developer solution made from ammonia (or ammonia vapor) converting the parts of the paper not exposed to the light source to a characteristic dark violet colour (blue-line).

=== Silkscreen ===

In [[screenprinting]] it is normally use a contact copier box with several [[fluorescent tube]]s close to the silk frame. The emulsion reacts depending on the amount of light received, for that reason it is important to make some tests for determining the exposure time. Usually for a &quot;box type&quot; contact copier, exposure is usually not more than one minute. In the industrial type contact copiers with actinic lamp placed at a distance, exposure time can be about 20 minutes.

The [[photolith]] (also called &quot;Art&quot;) is placed under the frame against the emulsion. The black portions of photolith film does not let light into the relevant parts of the coated silk, therefore, in these parts [[Emulsion]] will not heal and may be subsequently washed, keep in mind that there must be no gap between the photolith and the silk, to achieve that purpose any element with enough weight may be used to press the silk against the photolith (or a vacuum pump in professional machines).

=== Offset ===
 
In [[Computer to film|CTF]] offset technology, a [[photolith]] is placed in direct contact with the printing plate and pressed with an opaque lid that sometimes has a vacuum pump that helps making a good contact. The plate comes coated with a layer of [[photoresist]] in which a (negative) inverted image is formed with respect to the original [[photolith]] and after the transfer of information (burning) it's accomplished,  then, after undergoing a developing process, the plate will be ready to be used in an offset printer.&lt;ref name = &quot;Board2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=NIIR board |title=Hand Book on Printing Technology (offset, Gravure, Flexo, Screen) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aMvZQJwVfk0C&amp;pg=PA222 |date=1 October 2002 |publisher=National Institute Of Industrial Research |isbn=978-81-7833-087-7 |pages=222-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process shares some fundamental principles with the photographic processes, since the pattern engraved on the plate is generated by exposure to light with an image created in a contact copier using an optical mask. This procedure is comparable to the high-precision method of the version used to make printed circuit boards.

===Printed circuits ===
The contact copier is used today, particularly in the areas hobbyist, for the photoengraving of prototype [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) before being sent to production (artisanal creation ). Substantially similar to the contact printer used in photography, this variant usually uses ultraviolet lamps to impress a copper base specifically pre-sensitized.

Burned by exposure to light parts reproduce patterns drawn on a transparent photolith film on a pre-sensitized plate ([[epoxy]] or [[Bakelite]]). This pre-sensitized plate comprises an insulating plate (epoxy resin or bakelite), adhered with a layer of copper, and coated with a varnish layer sensitized. The varnish is sensitive to UV rays, which weaken or strengthen its structure depending on whether a &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; process. Photolith film printed parts (usually black), inserted between the light source and the pre-sensitized plate, protect the varnish from the UV. The base copper impressed must then be engraved in a specific bath (usually iron chloride -FeCl3-), that  removes the excess copper.&lt;!--

[[File:Navrh_plosny_spoj_vyroba.png|thumb| A photolitah film as used in PCB-s [[contact copier]]s.]]

A '''photolith film'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/photolith Photolith dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt; is a transparent film, made with some sort of tranparent plastic (formerly made of [[acetate]]). Nowadays, with the use of laser printers and computers, the photolith film can be based on polyester, vegetable paper or laser film paper. It is mainly used in all [[photolithography]] processes.

A color image, or polychromatic, is divided into four basic colors: [[cyan]], the [[magenta]], the [[yellow]] and [[black]] (the so-called system [[CMYK]] (short name from ''cyan'', '' magenta '', '' yellow '' and '' black ''), generating four photolith film images, a photo filtered with each of the three basic colors plus a B&amp;W film (addition of the three). For black-and-white images, such as text or simple logos, only one photolith film is needed.

The ''photolith film'' it is sometimes recorded by an optical laser process on an ''[[imagesetter]]'' machine, coming from a digital file, or by a photographic process in a [[contact copier]], if a physical copy of the original already exist. In the old offset printing plates acquire text or images to be printed after being sensitized from a photolith film.

The photolith films, as well as vegetable and the ''laser'' films, are used to store plates, screens or other media sensitive to [[light]] as a backup for repeating their processes in the future. They normally store the information of the three or four separated [[colour]]s on monochrome photolith films.

[[File:Venedig-in-Wien-Lageplan.jpg|thumb|250px|Plot plan]]
A '''plot plan''' is an architecture, [[engineering]], and/or [[landscape architecture]] [[Plan (drawing)|plan]] drawing—diagram which shows the [[buildings]], utility runs, and equipment layout, the position of [[roads]],  and other constructions of an existing or proposed project site at a defined scale. Plot plans are also known more commonly as [[site plan]]s. The plot plan is a 'top-down' orientation.

The specific objects and relations shown are dependent on the purpose for creating the plot plan, but typically contain: retained and proposed  buildings, landscape elements, above ground features and obstructions, major infrastructure routes, and critical legal considerations such as property boundaries, setbacks, and rights of way.

Specific design disciplines' plot plans can be part of a complex project's documents, such as grading, landscape, foundation engineering, and utilities.

[[File:Site Plan 24hPlans.jpg|thumb|240x240px|Example of a Site plan.]]
A '''site plan''' is an [[architectural plan]], [[landscape architecture]] document, and a detailed [[engineering drawing]] of proposed improvements to a given [[Lot (real estate)|lot]]. A site plan usually shows a building footprint, travelways, parking, drainage facilities, sanitary sewer lines, water lines, trails, lighting, and landscaping and garden elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=638 Department of Building and Development Land Development]. Loudoun County Government. Accessed 11 Feb 2009. {{wayback|url=http://www.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=638 |date=20100527163406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a [[plan]] of a site is a &quot;graphic [[Depiction|representation]] of the arrangement of buildings, parking, drives, landscaping and any other structure that is part of a [[Real estate development|development]] [[project]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamitwpoh.gov/commdev/fees_applications/faqs/faqs.htm Frequently Asked Questions] {{dead link|date=August 2014}}Miami Township. Accessed 11 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A site plan is a &quot;set of [[construction drawing]]s that a builder or contractor uses to make improvements to a property. Counties can use the site plan to verify that development codes are being met and as a historical resource. Site plans are often prepared by a design consultant who must be either a licensed engineer, architect, landscape architect or land surveyor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.chesterfield.va.us/CommunityDevelopment/Planning/GeneralInformation/SitePlanProc2005.pdf Site Planning Process] Chesterfield County, Virginia Planning Department. Accessed 11 Feb 2009. {{wayback|url=http://www.co.chesterfield.va.us/CommunityDevelopment/Planning/GeneralInformation/SitePlanProc2005.pdf |date=20090329054039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site plan topics ==
=== Site analysis ===
[[Site analysis]] is an inventory completed as a preparatory step to [[site planning]], a form of [[urban planning]] which involves research, analysis, and synthesis. It primarily deals with basic data as it relates to a specific site. The topic itself branches into the boundaries of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], and [[urban planning]]. 
Site Analysis is an element in site planning and design. [[Kevin A. Lynch]], an [[urban planner]] developed an eight cycle step process of site design, in which the second step is site analysis, the focus of this section.

=== Site plan building blocks ===
A site plan is a top view, [[bird’s eye view]] of a property that is drawn to scale. A site plan can show:[http://www.sanjoseca.gov/documentcenter/view/449 Site Plans, Elevations and Floor Plans] Plan Instructions (Site Plans, Elevations and Floor Plans)
* Property lines
* Outline of existing and proposed buildings and structures
* Distance between buildings
* Distance between buildings and property lines (setbacks)
* Parking lots, indicating parking spaces
* Driveways
* Surrounding streets
* Landscaped areas
* Easements
* Ground sign location
* Utilities

=== Site planning ===
[[Site planning]] in landscape architecture and architecture refers to the organizational stage of the landscape design process. It involves the organization of land use zoning, access, circulation, privacy, security, shelter, land drainage, and other factors. This is done by arranging the compositional elements of landform, planting, water, buildings and paving and building. 
Site planning generally begins by assessing a potential site for development through site analysis. Information about slope, soils, hydrology, vegetation, parcel ownership, orientation, etc. are assessed and mapped. By determining areas that are poor for development (such as floodplain or steep slopes) and better for development, the planner or architect can assess optimal location and design a structure that works within this space.

=== Transportation planning ===
[[Transportation planning]] is the field involved with the siting of [[transport]]ation facilities (generally [[street]]s, [[highway]]s, sidewalks, bike lanes and [[public transport]] lines). Transportation planning historically has followed the [[rational planning model]] of defining goals and objectives, identifying problems, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and developing the plan. Other models for planning include [[rational actor]], [[satisficing]], [[incremental planning]], organizational process, and political bargaining. However, planners are increasingly expected to adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, especially due to the rising importance of [[environmentalism]]. For example, the use of [[behaviorism|behavioral psychology]] to persuade drivers to abandon their [[automobile]]s and use [[public transport]] instead. The role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting [[sustainability]] through integrated transport [[policy|policies]].Southern, A. (2006), Modern-day transport planners need to be both technically proficient and politically astute, ''Local Transport Today'', no. 448, 27 July 2005.

=== Urban planning ===
[[Urban planning|Urban, city, and town planning]] is the integration of the disciplines of land use planning and transport planning, to explore a very wide range of aspects of the built and social environments of urbanized municipalities and communities. Regional planning deals with a still larger environment, at a less detailed level. Based upon the origins of urban planning from the Roman (pre-Dark Ages) era, the current discipline revisits the synergy of the disciplines of urban planning, architecture and landscape architecture, varying upon from the interlectural strategic positioning from university to university.

A '''shop drawing''' is a drawing or set of drawings produced by the [[General contractor|contractor]], [[Distributor (business)|supplier]], [[manufacturer]], [[subcontractor]], or [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricator]].&lt;ref name=shopdrawing/&gt; Shop drawings are typically required for [[prefabricate]]d components. Examples of these include: elevators, structural steel, trusses, pre-cast, windows, appliances, cabinets, air handling units, and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. Also critical are the installation and coordination shop drawings of the [[Architectural engineering#Mechanical.2C Electrical and Plumbing .28MEP.29|MEP]] trades such as sheet metal ductwork, piping, plumbing, fire protection, and electrical. Shop drawings are not produced by [[architects]] and [[engineers]] under their contract with the owner. The shop drawing is the manufacturer’s or the contractor’s drawn version of information shown in the construction documents.&lt;ref name=shopdrawing/&gt; The shop drawing normally shows more detail than the construction documents. It is drawn to explain the fabrication and/or installation of the items to the manufacturer’s production crew or contractor's installation crews. The style of the shop drawing is usually very different from that of the architect’s drawing. The shop drawing’s primary emphasis is on the particular product or installation and excludes [[notation]] concerning other products and installations, unless integration with the subject product is necessary.&lt;ref name=shopdrawing&gt;{{cite journal |author = R Pietroforte |title = Construction Management &amp; Economics |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1997 |url = http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/NK64AXLX9821K3M4.pdf | format =  [[PDF]] |accessdate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information required to be included in Shop Drawings==

===Comparison information for the architect and engineer===
The shop drawings should include information for the architect and engineer to compare to the [[specifications]] and [[drawings]]. The shop drawing should address the appearance, [[performance]], and [[prescriptive]] descriptions in the specifications and construction drawings.&lt;ref name = information&gt;{{cite journal |author1=RM Crowder |author2=W Hall |author3=I Heath |author4=R Bernard |author5=D Gaskell |title= A hypermedia maintenance information system |version= |publisher= Computing &amp; Control Engineering Journal |year= 1996 |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=503166 |accessdate= 2007-02-23 |doi= 10.1049/ccej:19960305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The shop drawing often is more detailed than the information shown in the construction documents to give the architect and engineer the opportunity to review the [[fabricator’s version]] of the product, prior to fabrication. References to the construction documents, drawings, and specifications assist the architect and engineer in their review of the shop drawings. Attachment of manufacturer’s material specifications, “catalog cut sheets,” and other manufacturer’s information may be helpful to accompany these drawings. Because shop drawings facilitate the architect’s and engineer’s approval of the product, they should be as clear and complete as possible.

===Notes of changes or alterations from the construction documents===
Notes concerning changes or differences from the original documents should be made on the shop drawing for the architect’s and engineer’s approval. Ultimately, they are responsible for changes in these drawings and should have the opportunity to analyze any modifications. A dialogue should occur between the fabricator and the architect and engineer about any areas needing clarification. Successful installations are the result of collaboration between the [[designer]], fabricator, and contractor.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Information needed to fabricate the product===
Dimensions, manufacturing conventions, and special fabrication instructions should be included on the shop drawing. It should be clear to fabrication personnel what will be manufactured from the shop drawings alone. The construction documents are rarely used as a reference in fabrication, with the fabricators relying on the shop drawing for all information.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Indication of dimensions needing verification from the jobsite===
Most jobsite dimensions, such as the dimensions between two surfaces on the jobsite, need to be verified. A dimension may be shown on the construction drawings, but the actual dimension may vary, from very small to large increments, depending on jobsite conditions. It is extremely important that the fabricated item arrive on the jobsite ready to be installed without field modification. Special care must be taken by the contractor to measure and verify dimensions. In new construction, plan dimensions usually are sufficient for ordering many fabricated items such as [[structural steel]] or [[precast concrete]].&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

In [[remodeling]] and [[renovation]] work, it is essential that field dimensions be verified prior to fabrication. Some fabricators, such as [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] and casework suppliers, prefer not to rely on the contractor’s verification and will verify the dimensions with their own personnel.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Placement or installation information===
Some fabricators and manufacturers will provide symbols, data, or instructions concerning installation. This can include a list of other materials, such as [[fastener]]s or [[adhesive]]s, appropriate but not included for the product.

Third party review may be required for major building systems. An example of this would be a commercial chiller which would be furnished by the mechanical contractor, but would require electrical connections, plumbing, rigging, insulation and commissioning. Various third parties will need to review the installation information and confirm they are furnishing compatible equipment and proper layout of services. Review of installation information for major equipment should be reviewed with field supervisors including the project superintendent, trade foremen and field engineer. Installation of major equipment will dictate structural clearances and temporary openings.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Samples===
Some fabrications will require a [[sample submittal]] with the shop drawing, primarily for [[color]] and [[wikt:texture|texture]] selection of finishes.&lt;ref name = information/&gt;

===Computer-aided Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Design Coordination===
Problems with design coordination, such as time consumption and ineffectiveness related to the current 2D paper-based process, are some of the top concerns of a general contractor, since late conflict correction increases the potential for errors in the field. In order to address this issue, there have been an increasing number of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) firms utilizing building information models (BIM) in their coordination and clash detection processes, which according to practitioners, allows for increased coordination and fewer field problems. Leite et al.&lt;ref&gt;Leite, F.; Akinci, B.; Garrett, J. (2009) Identification of data items needed for automatic clash detection in MEP design coordination. In: Proceedings of the 2009 Construction Research Congress, Seattle, WA.&lt;/ref&gt; compared types of clashes identified in a manual coordination process (overlay of 2D drawings on a light table by pairs of subcontractors) and through automatic clash detection using a [[Building information modeling|Building Information Model]] (BIM). The automatic clash detection identified several clashes that were missed by the subcontractors, who were performing this task manually. Also, the manual clash detection identified clashes which could not possibly be found by the automatic clash detection software, since one of the clashing objects (e.g. cable trays) was not modeled in the BIM. This study also included site observations of field detected clashes, some of which were not identified in either manual or automatic processes. Leite noted that the combination of clashes identified in coordination meetings, those automatically detected, as well as those identified in the field enable identification of objects that need to be modeled in order to capture the largest possible number of clashes. This paper was limited to the comparison of types of clashes identified in each of the three methods during a specific project. Although their results cannot be generalized, they still provide insight towards the need to identify what needs to be modeled in a BIM for MEP coordination prior to the start of the coordination process.

==Reviews==
Because writing comments on eight to ten copies is a tedious process and an inefficient use of the architect and engineer's time, they will frequently specify other 
methods for distributing comments. Quick review is essential during the approval process.&lt;ref name=reviews&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S Shahid |author2=T Froese |title= Project Management Information Control Systems |publisher= Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering |year= 1998 |url= http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet&amp;journal=cjce&amp;volume=25&amp;calyLang=fra&amp;articleFile=l98-012.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |accessdate= 2007-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any method that facilitates this, while providing ample opportunity for comment and complete distribution, should be considered. Although a procedure may be specified in the contract drawings, most architects and engineers are open to suggestions and innovations that speed up the process.

===Number of copies===
Shop drawings are required, in various forms, depending upon the practice of the 
architect and engineer. A specific number of copies may be required by the 
specification. An example distribution of the completed and corrected shop 
drawings may include the:

*Owner—file or inspection copy
*Architect—file copy
*Architect—field copy or inspection copy
*Consulting engineer—file copy
*Consulting engineer—inspection copy
*Contractor—file copy
*Contractor—field copy
*Supplier—original copy or one copy

===Submittal of one or two copies of the shop drawing===
Corrections are made by the architect and engineer, and the shop drawing is corrected by the supplier, then the appropriate number of copies is distributed. This method can be time consuming, as the shop drawing is not approved until the corrections are made on it.&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;

===Submittal of a copy that can be reproduced ===
The architect and engineer make comments on the reproducible, then copies are distributed. This method facilitates the timely approval and distribution of the shop drawing. Review comments usually are obvious on the reproducible copy. When [[sepia tone|sepia]] copies are used, 
the reproduction of the sepia often is not as clear as a normal blue-line print.&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;

===Compatible CAD software===
When the supplier and designer have compatible [[CAD]] software or when universal file formats such as [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]], [[PDF]] or [[DWG]] are utilized, the review can be made from a CD, [[email]] or [[FTP]] transfer. Comments can be made by the designer in a bold font or changes can be boxed for emphasis.

Popular CAD platforms used for generating shop drawings are [[Advance Steel]], [[AutoCAD]], [[CATIA]], [[Creo Elements/Pro]], [[Autodesk Inventor|Inventor]], [[Solidworks]] and [[Tekla Structures]].

==Shop drawings in concrete reinforcing==
Concrete reinforcing is one of the many items requiring specialized shop drawings for the fabrication of the material. Concrete reinforcing is custom-fabricated from 60-foot-long [[reinforcing bar]]s.&lt;ref name = concrete&gt;{{cite journal |author= VKR Kodur |title= Performance-based fire resistance design of concrete-filled steel columns |publisher= Journal of Constructional Steel Research |year= 1999 |url= http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0143974X99000036 |accessdate= 2007-02-23 |doi=10.1016/S0143-974X(99)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reinforcing bars are cut to length and bent to specific configurations. The shop drawing and the accompanying “cut sheet” lists the quantity, sizes, lengths, and shapes of the reinforcing bar.&lt;ref name = concrete/&gt; This information is provided for review by the [[structural engineer]] to ensure that sufficient reinforcing is being supplied; fabrication of the bar by the supplier’s shop; an [[inventory]] list for the contractor, upon delivery the typical project has thousands of pieces of reinforcing steel that need to be organized for storage and installation; and placement by the ironworker. The [[Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute]] (CRSI) has developed standard symbols, graphics, and formats for shop drawings and cut sheets that generally are used by reinforcing steel fabricators.&lt;ref name = concrete/&gt; Each fabricator, has particular style for shop drawings and cut sheets, depending on the draftspeople and [[Computer-aided design]] systems. Examples of software used are [[Advance Concrete]], [[AutoCAD]], [[MicroStation]], ProConcrete and [[Tekla Structures]].

'''Technical Illustration''' is the use of [[illustration]] to visually communicate information of a [[technology|technical nature]]. Technical illustrations can be components of [[technical drawing]]s or [[diagram]]s. Technical illustrations in general aim &quot;to generate expressive [[image]]s that effectively convey certain [[information]] via the visual channel to the human observer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ViGr05&quot;&gt;Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gröller (2005). &quot;[http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2005/Viola-05-Smart/Viola-05-Smart-Paper.pdf Smart Visibility in Visualization]&quot;. In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical illustrations generally have to describe and explain the subjects to a nontechnical [[audience]]. Therefore, the visual image should be accurate in terms of dimensions and proportions, and should provide &quot;an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer’s interest and understanding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devis|first1=Mae|title=משרביות|url=http://www.laser-group.co.il/משרביות/|website=www.laser-group.co.il|accessdate=14 June 2016|date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of communication===
Today, technical illustration can be broken down into three categories{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} based on the type of [[communication]]:

* Communication with the [[general public]] : informs the general public, for example illustrated instructions found in the manuals for automobiles and consumer electronics. This type of technical illustration contains simple terminology and symbols that can be understood by the lay person and is sometimes called creative technical illustration/graphics.
* Specialized [[engineering]] or [[scientific]] communication : used by engineers/scientists to communicate with their peers and in [[specification]]s. This use of technical illustration has its own complex terminology and specialized symbols; examples are the fields of atomic energy, aerospace and military/defense. These areas can be further broken down into disciplines of mechanical, electrical, architectural engineering and many more.
* Communication between highly skilled [[expert]]s : used by engineers to communicate with people who are highly skilled in a field, but who are not engineers. Examples of this type of technical illustration are illustrations found in user/operator documentation. These illustrations can be very complex and have jargon and symbols not understood by the general public, such as illustrations that are part of instructional materials for operating [[CNC]] machinery.

===Types of drawings===
Main types of drawings in technical communication are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliu|first1=Gerald J. Alred, Charles T. Brusaw, Walter E.|title=The business writer's handbook|date=2012|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|location=Boston|isbn=0312679432|page=172|edition=10th|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0312679432|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* conventional [[Line art|line drawing]]s,
* [[exploded view drawing]]s,
* [[cutaway drawing]]s, and
* [[clip art]] images

==Techniques==
Technical illustration uses several basic mechanical drawing configurations called axonometric projection. These are: 
* [[Parallel projection]]s (oblique, planometric, isometric, dimetric, and trimetric), and
* many types of [[perspective projection]]s (with one, two, or three [[vanishing point]]s).
Technical illustration and [[computer-aided design]] can also use 3D and solidbody projections, such as [[rapid prototyping]].
*In the natural sciences, &quot;scientific illustration&quot; refers to a style of drawing using stippling and simple line techniques to convey information with a minimum of artistic interpretation.

'''Embryo drawing''' is the [[illustration]] of [[embryo]]s in their [[Embryogenesis|developmental sequence]]. In plants and animals, an embryo develops from a [[zygote]], the single cell that results when an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and [[sperm]] fuse during [[fertilization]].  In animals, the zygote divides repeatedly to form a ball of cells, which then forms a set of tissue layers that migrate and fold to form an early embryo. Images of embryos provide a means of comparing embryos of different ages, and [[species (biology)|species]]. To this day, embryo drawings are made in [[undergraduate]] [[developmental biology]] lessons.

[[Image:Gray41.png|thumb|200px|Drawing of the head of a four-week-old human embryo. From [[Gray's Anatomy]].]]

Comparing different embryonic stages of different animals is a tool that can be used to infer relationships between species, and thus [[biological evolution]]. This has been a source of quite some controversy, both now and in the past. [[Ernst Haeckel]] pioneered in this field. By comparing different embryonic stages of different [[vertebrate]] species, he formulated the [[recapitulation theory]]. This [[theory]] states that an animal's embryonic development follows exactly the same sequence as the sequence of its evolutionary ancestors. Haeckel's work and the ensuing controversy linked the fields of [[developmental biology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] into comparative [[embryology]]. From a more modern perspective, Haeckel's drawings were the beginnings of the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

The study of comparative embryology aims to prove or disprove that vertebrate embryos of different [[class (biology)|classes]] (e.g. mammals vs. fish) follow a similar developmental path due to their common ancestry. Such developing vertebrates have similar [[gene]]s, which determine the basic body plan. However, further development allows for the distinguishing of distinct characteristics as adults.

==Use of embryo drawings and photography in contemporary biology==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
In current biology, fundamental research in developmental biology and evolutionary developmental biology is no longer driven by [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] comparisons between embryos, but more by [[molecular biology]]. This is partly because Haeckel's drawings were very inaccurate.

==Controversy==
The exactness of [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s drawings of embryos has caused much controversy among [[Intelligent Design]] proponents recently and Haeckel's intellectual opponents in the past.  Although the early embryos of different species exhibit similarities, Haeckel apparently exaggerated these similarities in support of his [[Recapitulation theory]], sometimes known as the [[Biogenetic Law]] or &quot;[[Ontogeny]] recapitulates [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]]&quot;. Furthermore, Haeckel even proposed theoretical life-forms to accommodate certain stages in embryogenesis. A recent review concluded that the &quot;biogenetic law is supported by several recent studies - if applied to single characters only&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael K. Richardson and Gerhard Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of evolution and development&quot;, ''Biol. Rev.'' (2002) '''77''', 495-528&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Karl von Baer]] and [[Wilhelm His, Sr.|Wilhelm His]], did not believe that living embryos reproduce the evolutionary process and produced embryo drawings of their own&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/history_10
|title=Developmental Similarities: Karl von Baer
|publisher=''University of California Museum of Paleontology''
|accessdate={{date|2012-03-13}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized the differences in early embryological development. Late 20th and early 21st century critics [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wells, Jonathan|title=Icons of Evolution|publisher=Regnery Publishing|location=Washington, DC|year=2000|pages=108–109|isbn=0-89526-200-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay. &quot;Abscheulich! (Atrocious!): Haeckel's distortions did not help Darwin&quot;. Nat. Hist. 109 (March 2000): 42-49.&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the continued use of Haeckel’s embryo drawings in textbooks.

On the other hand, Michael K. Richardson, Professor of Evolutionary Developmental Zoology, [[Leiden University]], while recognizing that some criticisms of the drawings are legitimate (indeed, it was he and his co-workers who began the modern criticisms in 1998), has supported the drawings as teaching aids,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Haeckel's much-criticized drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution. While some criticisms of the drawings are legitimate, others are more tenditious.&quot;, M. K. Richardson and G. Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of evolution and development&quot;, ''Biol. Rev.'' (2002) '''77''', 495-528 (quote from abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; and has said that &quot;on a fundamental level, Haeckel was correct&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Letter to ''Science'', '''280''', (15 May 1998), 983-984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous embryo illustrators==

===Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919)===
[[Image:Haeckel drawings.jpg|thumb|250px|Romanes' 1892 copy of [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s allegedly fraudulent embryo drawings (this version of the figure is often attributed incorrectly to Haeckel).&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Keuck, &quot;Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development,&quot; p. 516&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Haeckel’s illustrations show vertebrate embryos at different stages of development, which exhibit embryonic resemblance as support for evolution, recapitulation as evidence of the Biogenetic Law, and phenotypic divergence as evidence of [[Karl Ernst von Baer#Baer's laws|von Baer’s laws]]. The series of twenty-four embryos from the early editions of Haeckel’s ''Anthropogenie'' remain the most famous. The different species are arranged in columns, and the different stages in rows. Similarities can be seen along the first two rows; the appearance of specialized characters in each species can be seen in the columns and a diagonal interpretation leads one to Haeckel’s idea of recapitulation.

Haeckel’s embryo drawings are primarily intended to express his [[idiosyncratic]] theory of embryonic development, the Biogenetic Law, which in turn assumes (but is not crucial to) the evolutionary concept of [[common descent]]. His postulation of embryonic development coincides with his understanding of evolution as a developmental process.&lt;ref&gt;Nyhart, ''Biology Takes Form'', pp. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;  In and around 1800, embryology fused with comparative anatomy as the primary foundation of [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud&quot;, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst Haeckel, along with Karl von Baer and Wilhelm His, are primarily influential in forming the preliminary foundations of ‘phylogenetic embryology’ based on principles of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Keuck, &quot;Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development,&quot; p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;  Haeckel’s ‘Biogenetic Law’ portrays the parallel relationship between an embryo’s development and phylogenetic history.  The term, ‘recapitulation,’ has come to embody Haeckel’s Biogenetic Law, for embryonic development is a recapitulation of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nyhart, ''Biology Takes Form'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Haeckel proposes that all classes of vertebrates pass through an evolutionarily conserved “[[Phylotype|phylotypic]]” stage of development, a period of reduced phenotypic diversity among higher embryos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keuck p. 506&quot;&gt;Richardson and Keuck, &quot;Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development,&quot; p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;  Only in later development do particular differences appear.  Haeckel portrays a concrete demonstration of his Biogenetic Law through his ‘[[Gastrea]]’ theory, in which he argues that the early cup-shaped [[gastrula]] stage of development is a universal feature of multi-celled animals.  An ancestral form existed, known as the gastrea, which was a common ancestor to the corresponding gastrula.&lt;ref&gt;Nyhart, ''Biology Takes Form'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Haeckel argues that certain features in embryonic development are conserved and [[Palingenesis|palingenetic]], while others are [[Caenogenesis|caenogenetic]]. Caenogenesis represents “the blurring of ancestral resemblances in development,” which are said to be the result of certain adaptations to embryonic life due to environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Keuck, &quot;Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development,&quot; p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;  In his drawings, Haeckel cites the [[notochord]], [[Branchial arch|pharyngeal arches]] and clefts, [[pronephros]] and [[neural tube]] as palingenetic features.  However, the [[yolk sac]], extra-embryonic membranes, egg membranes and [[Endocardium|endocardial]] tube are considered caenogenetic features.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Keuck, &quot;Haeckel’s ABC of evolution and development,&quot; p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;  The addition of terminal adult stages and the telescoping, or driving back, of such stages to descendant’s embryonic stages are likewise representative of Haeckelian embryonic development.  In addressing his embryo drawings to a general audience, Haeckel does not cite any sources, which gives his opponents the freedom to make assumptions regarding the originality of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud&quot;, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876)===
Haeckel was not the only one to create a series of drawings representing embryonic development.  [[Karl Ernst von Baer|Karl E. von Baer]] and Haeckel both struggled to model one of the most complex problems facing embryologists at the time: the arrangement of general and special characters during development in different species of animals.  In relation to developmental timing, von Baer's scheme of development differs from Haeckel's scheme.  Von Baer's scheme of development need not be tied to developmental stages defined by particular characters, where recapitulation involves [[heterochrony]].  Heterochrony represents a gradual alteration in the original phylogenetic sequence due to embryonic adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,&quot; p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;
As well, von Baer early noted that embryos of different species could not be easily distinguished from one another as in adults.

[[Karl Ernst von Baer#Baer's laws|Von Baer’s laws]] governing embryonic development are specific rejections of recapitulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keuck p. 506&quot;/&gt;   As a response to Haeckel’s theory of recapitulation, von Baer enunciates his most notorious laws of development.  Von Baer’s laws state that general features of animals appear earlier in the embryo than special features, where less general features stem from the most general, each embryo of a species departs more and more from a predetermined passage through the stages of other animals, and there is never a complete morphological similarity between an embryo and a lower adult.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  Von Baer’s embryo drawings&lt;ref&gt;Where are these drawings?&lt;/ref&gt; display that individual development proceeds from general features of the developing embryo in early stages through differentiation into special features specific to the species, establishing that linear evolution could not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, ''The Meaning of Evolution'', p. 57-59&lt;/ref&gt;  Embryological development, in von Baer’s mind, is a process of differentiation, “a movement from the more [[wikt:homogeneous|homogeneous]] and universal to the more [[heterogeneous]] and individual.”&lt;ref&gt;Richards, ''The Meaning of Evolution'', p. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Baer argues that embryos will resemble each other before attaining characteristics differentiating them as part of a specific [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]] or [[species]], but embryos are not the same as the final forms of lower organisms.

===Wilhelm His (1831-1904)===
Wilhelm His was one of Haeckel’s most authoritative and primary opponents advocating physiological embryology.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''Anatomie menschlicher Embryonen'' (Anatomy of human embryos) employs a series of his most important drawings chronicling developing embryos from the end of the second week through the end of the second month of pregnancy.  His, in opposition to Haeckel, seeks to take human embryos out of the hands of Darwinist proponents.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}  In 1878, His begins to engage in serious study of the anatomy of human embryos for his drawings.  During the 19th century, embryologists often obtained early human embryos from abortions and miscarriages, postmortems of pregnant women and collections in anatomical museums.&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Producing Development&quot;, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to construct his series of drawings, His collected specimens which he manipulated into a form that he could operate with.

In His’ ''Normentafel'', he displays specific individual embryos rather than ideal types.&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Producing Development&quot;, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;   His does not produce norms from aborted specimens, but rather visualizes the embryos in order to make them comparable and specifically subjects his embryo specimens to criticism and comparison with other cases.  Ultimately, His’ critical work in embryonic development comes with his production of a series of embryo drawings of increasing length and degree of development.&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Producing Development&quot;, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  His’ depiction of embryological development strongly differs from Haeckel’s depiction, for His argues that the phylogenetic explanation of ontogenetic events is unnecessary.  His argues that all ontogenetic events are the “mechanical” result of differential cell growth.&lt;ref&gt;Di Gregorio, ''From Here to Eternity'', p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  His’ embryology is not explained in terms of ancestral history.

The debate between Haeckel and His ultimately becomes fueled by the description of an embryo that [[Wilhelm Krause (anatomist)|Wilhelm Krause]] propels directly into the ongoing feud between Haeckel and His.  Haeckel speculates that the [[allantois]] is formed in a similar way in both humans and other mammals.  His, on the other hand, accuses Haeckel of altering and playing with the facts.  Although Haeckel is proven right about the allantois, the utilization of Krause’s embryo as justification turns out to be problematic, for the embryo is that of a bird rather than a human.  The underlying debate between Haeckel and His derives from differing viewpoints regarding the similarity or dissimilarity of vertebrate embryos.  In response to Haeckel’s evolutionary claim that all vertebrates are essentially identical in the first month of embryonic life as proof of common descent, His responds by insisting that a more skilled observer would recognize even sooner that early embryos can be distinguished.  His also counteracts Hacekel’s sequence of drawings in the ''Anthropogenie'' with what he refers to as “exact” drawings, highlighting specific differences.  Ultimately, His goes so far as to accuse Haeckel of “faking” his embryo illustrations to make the vertebrate embryos appear more similar than in reality.  His also accuses Haeckel of creating early human embryos that he conjured in his imagination rather than obtained through [[empirical]] observation.  His completes his denunciation of Haeckel by pronouncing that Haeckel had “‘relinquished the right to count as an equal in the company of serious researchers.’”&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Producing Development&quot;, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to Haeckel==
Haeckel encountered numerous oppositions to his artistic depictions of embryonic development during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Haeckel’s opponents believe that he de-emphasizes the differences between early embryonic stages in order to make the similarities between embryos of different species more pronounced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopwood p. 282&quot;&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud&quot;, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

The first suggestion of fakery against Haeckel was made in late 1868 by Ludwig Rutimeyer in the ''Archiv für Anthropogenie''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopwood p. 282&quot;/&gt;  Rutimeyer was a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the [[University of Basel]], who rejected natural selection as simply mechanistic and proposed an anti-materialist view of nature.  Rutimeyer claimed that Haeckel “had taken to kinds of liberty with established truth.”&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud&quot;, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;  Rutimeyer claimed that Haeckel presented the same image three consecutive times as the embryo of the dog, the chicken, and the turtle.&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud&quot;, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Rutimeyer did not denounce Haeckel’s embryo drawings as fraud, he argued that such drawings are manipulations of public and scientific thought{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

[[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm Bischoff|Theodor Bischoff]] (1807–1882), was a strong opponent of [[Darwinism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  As a pioneer in mammalian embryology, he was one of Haeckel’s strongest critics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Although Bischoff’s 1840 surveys depict how similar the early embryos of man are to other vertebrates, he later demanded that such hasty generalization was inconsistent with his recent findings regarding the dissimilarity between hamster embryos and those of rabbits and dogs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Nevertheless, Bischoff’s main argument was in reference to Haeckel’s drawings of human embryos, for Haeckel is later accused of miscopying the dog embryo from him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hopwood p. 282&quot;/&gt; Throughout Haeckel’s time, criticism of his embryo drawings was often due in part to his critics' belief in his representations of embryological development as “crude schemata.”&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud&quot;, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, Haeckel specifically selected relevant features to portray in his drawings.  Haeckel’s opponents found his methods problematic because such simplification eliminates certain structures that differentiate between higher and lower vertebrates.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  In 1877, [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821–1902), once an inspiration to Haeckel at [[Würzburg]], proclaimed that Haeckel’s embryo drawings represent mere hypotheses{{Citation needed|reason=feb07-e4mmacro|date=February 2007}}.

===Contemporary criticism of Haeckel: Michael Richardson and Stephen Jay Gould===
Michael Richardson and his colleagues in a July 1997 issue of ''Anatomy and Embryology'',&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, M.K., Hanken, J., Gooneratne, M.L., Pieau, C., Raynaud. A., Selwood, L. and Wright, G.M. (1997): There is no highly conserved embryonic stage in the vertebrates: implications for current theories of evolution and development. Anatomy and Embryology 196(2): 91-106.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that Haeckel fudged his drawings in order to exaggerate the similarity of the phylotypic stage.
In a March 2000 issue of ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'', Stephen Jay Gould argued that Haeckel “exaggerated the similarities by idealizations and omissions.” As well, Gould argued that Haeckel’s drawings are simply inaccurate and falsified.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, one of those who criticized Haeckel's drawings, Michael Richardson, has argued that &quot;Haeckel's much-criticized drawings are important as phylogenetic hypotheses, teaching aids, and evidence for evolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of evolution and development&quot;, ''Biol. Rev.'' (2002) '''77''', 495-528&lt;/ref&gt;
But even Richardson admitted in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' Magazine in 1997 that his team's investigation of Haeckel's drawings were showing them to be &quot;one of the most famous fakes in biology.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Some version of Haeckel’s drawings can be found in many modern biology textbooks in discussions of the history of embryology, with clarification that these are no longer considered valid .&lt;ref&gt;Futuyma, Douglas, &quot;Evolutionary Biology,&quot; p. 652-653&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haeckel's proponents (past and present)==
Although Charles Darwin accepted Haeckel's support for natural selection, he was tentative in using Haeckel's ideas in his writings; with regard to embryology, Darwin relied far more on von Baer's work.  Haeckel's work was published in 1866 and 1874, years after Darwin's &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; (1859).

Despite the numerous oppositions, Haeckel has influenced many disciplines in science in his drive to integrate such disciplines of taxonomy and embryology into the Darwinian framework and to investigate phylogenetic reconstruction through his Biogenetic Law.  As well, Haeckel served as a mentor to many important scientists, including [[Anton Dohrn]], [[Richard Hertwig|Richard]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]], [[Wilhelm Roux]], and [[Hans Driesch]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of evolution and development,&quot; p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Haeckel's earliest proponents was [[Carl Gegenbaur]] at the University of Jena (1865–1873), during which both men were absorbing the impact of Darwin's theory.  The two quickly sought to integrate their knowledge into an evolutionary program.  In determining the relationships between &quot;phylogenetic linkages&quot; and &quot;evolutionary laws of form,&quot; both Gegenbaur and Haeckel relied on a method of comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Nyhart, Lynn K., ''Biology Takes Form'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  As Gegenbaur argued, the task of comparative anatomy lies in explaining the form and organization of the animal body in order to provide evidence for the continuity and evolution of a series of organs in the body.  Haeckel then provided a means of pursuing this aim with his biogenetic law, in which he proposed to compare an individual's various stages of development with its ancestral line.  Although Haeckel stressed comparative embryology and Gegenbaur promoted the comparison of adult structures, both believed that the two methods could work in conjunction to produce the goal of evolutionary morphology.&lt;ref&gt;Nyhart, Lynn K., ''Biology Takes Form'', p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The philologist and anthropologist, [[Max Müller|Friedrich Müller]], used Haeckel's concepts as a source for his ethnological research, involving the systematic comparison of the folklore, beliefs and practices of different societies.  Müller's work relies specifically on theoretical assumptions that are very similar to Haeckel's and reflects the German practice to maintain strong connections between empirical research and the philosophical framework of science.  Language is particularly important, for it establishes a bridge between natural science and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Di Gregorio, Mario A., ''From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;  For Haeckel, language specifically represented the concept that all phenomena of human development relate to the laws of biology.&lt;ref&gt;Di Gregorio, Mario A., ''From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith'', p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Müller did not specifically have an influence in advocating Haeckel's embryo drawings, both shared a common understanding of development from lower to higher forms, for Müller specifically saw humans as the last link in an endless chain of evolutionary development.&lt;ref&gt;Di Gregorio, Mario A., ''From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern acceptance of Haeckel's Biogenetic Law, despite current rejection of Haeckelian views, finds support in the certain degree of parallelism between ontogeny and phylogeny.  A. M. Khazen, on the one hand, states that &quot;ontogeny is obliged to repeat the main stages of phylogeny.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson, Michael K p. 501&quot;&gt;Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,&quot; p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;  A. S. Rautian, on the other hand, argues that the reproduction of ancestral patterns of development is a key aspect of certain biological systems.  Dr. Rolf Siewing acknowledges the similarity of embryos in different species, along with the laws of von Baer, but does not believe that one should compare embryos with adult stages of development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson, Michael K p. 501&quot;/&gt;  According to M. S. Fischer, reconsideration of the Biogenetic Law is possible as a result of two fundamental innovations in biology since Haeckel's time: [[cladistics]] and developmental genetics.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,&quot; p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

In defense of Haeckel's embryo drawings, the principal argument is that of &quot;schematisation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson, Michael K p. 519&quot;&gt;Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,&quot; p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;  Haeckel's drawings were not intended to be technical and scientific depictions, but rather schematic drawings and reconstructions for a specifically lay audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson, Michael K p. 519&quot;/&gt;  Therefore, as R. Gursch argues, Haeckel's embryo drawings should be regarded as &quot;reconstructions.&quot;  Although his drawings are open to criticism, his drawings should not be considered falsifications of any sort.  Although modern defense of Haeckel's embryo drawings still considers the inaccuracy of his drawings, charges of fraud are considered unreasonable.  As [[Erland Nordenskiöld]] argues, charges of fraud against Haeckel are unnecessary.  R. Bender ultimately goes so far as to reject His's claims regarding the fabrication of certain stages of development in Haeckel's drawings, arguing that Haeckel's embryo drawings are faithful representations of real stages of embryonic development in comparison to published embryos.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Michael K. and Gerhard Keuck, &quot;Haeckel's ABC of Evolution and Development,&quot; p. 520&lt;/ref&gt;

==The survival and reproduction of Haeckel's embryo drawings==
Haeckel's embryo drawings, as comparative plates, were at first only copied into biology textbooks, rather than texts on the study of embryology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Even though Haeckel's program in comparative embryology virtually collapsed after the First World War,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} his embryo drawings have often been reproduced and redrawn with increased precision and accuracy in works that have kept the study of [[comparative embryology]] alive.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Nevertheless, neither His-inspired human embryology nor developmental biology are concerned with the comparison of vertebrate embryos.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Although Stephen Jay Gould's 1977 book ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' helps to reassess Haeckelian embryology, it does not address the controversy over Haeckel's embryo drawings.  Nevertheless, new interest in evolution in and around 1977 inspired developmental biologists to look more closely at Haeckel's illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Hopwood, &quot;Pictures of Evolution and Charges of Fraud,&quot; p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technical drawing''', '''drafting''' or '''draughting''', is the act and [[Academic discipline|discipline]] of composing [[Plan (drawing)|drawings]] that [[Visual communication|visually communicate]] how something functions or is to be constructed.

Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in [[industry]] and [[engineering]].
To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar [[symbols]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectives]], [[units of measurement]], [[notation]] systems, visual styles, and [[page layout]]. Together, such [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] constitute a [[visual language]], and help to ensure that the drawing is [[unambiguous]] and relatively easy to understand. These drafting conventions are condensed into internationally accepted standards and specifications that transcend the barrier of language making technical drawings a universal means of communicating complex mechanical concepts.

This need for precise communication in the preparation of a functional document distinguishes technical drawing from the expressive drawing of the [[visual arts]]. Artistic drawings are subjectively interpreted; their meanings are multiply determined. Technical drawings are understood to have one intended meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;g2000p3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Technical Drawing |edition=Fourth |last=Goetsch |first=David L. |last2=Chalk |first2=William S. |last3=Nelson |first3=John A. |year=2000 |publisher=Delmar Learning |series=Delmar Technical Graphics Series |location=[[Albany, New York|Albany]] |isbn=978-0-7668-0531-6 |oclc=39756434 |page=3 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[drafter]]'', ''draftsperson'', or ''draughtsman'' is a person who makes a [[drawing]] (technical or expressive). A professional drafter who makes technical drawings is sometimes called a ''drafting technician''. Professional drafting is a desirable and necessary function in the design and manufacture of complex mechanical components and machines. Professional draftspersons bridge the gap between engineers and manufacturers, and contribute experience and technical expertise to the design process.

==Methods==
===Manual or by instrument===
[[File:Zeichenmaschine.jpg|thumb|left|A drafting table]]
[[File:Technical drawing instruments 1.jpg|thumb|right|Old-fashioned technical drawing instruments]]
[[File:Stencils01.jpg|thumb|right|Stencils for lettering technical drawings to DIN standards]]
The basic drafting procedure is to place a piece of paper (or other material) on a smooth surface with right-angle corners and straight sides—typically a [[drawing board]]. A sliding [[straightedge]] known as a ''[[T-square]]'' is then placed on one of the sides, allowing it to be slid across the side of the table, and over the surface of the paper.

&quot;Parallel lines&quot; can be drawn simply by moving the T-square and running a pencil or [[technical pen]] along the T-square's edge. The T-square is used to hold other devices such as [[set square]]s or triangles. In this case the drafter places one or more triangles of known angles on the T-square—which is itself at right angles to the edge of the table—and can then draw lines at any chosen angle to others on the page. Modern drafting tables come equipped with a [[drafting machine]] that is supported on both sides of the table to slide over a large piece of paper. Because it is secured on both sides, lines drawn along the edge are guaranteed to be parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatt|first=N.D|title=Machine Drawing|publisher=Charotar Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the drafter uses several [[technical drawing tools]] to draw curves and circles. Primary among these are the [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]], used for drawing simple arcs and circles, and the [[French curve]],for drawing curves. A [[Flat spline|spline]] is a rubber coated articulated metal that can be manually bent to most curves.

Drafting templates assist the drafter with creating recurring objects in a drawing without having to reproduce the object from scratch every time. This is especially useful when using common symbols; i.e. in the context of [[stagecraft]], a lighting designer will draw from the [[USITT]] standard library of lighting fixture symbols to indicate the position of a common fixture across multiple positions. Templates are sold commercially by a number of vendors, usually customized to a specific task, but it is also not uncommon for a drafter to create his own templates.

This basic drafting system requires an accurate table and constant attention to the positioning of the tools. A common error is to allow the triangles to push the top of the T-square down slightly, thereby throwing off all angles. Even tasks as simple as drawing two angled lines meeting at a point require a number of moves of the T-square and triangles, and in general drafting can be a time-consuming process.

A solution to these problems was the introduction of the mechanical &quot;drafting machine&quot;, an application of the [[pantograph]] (sometimes referred to incorrectly as a &quot;pentagraph&quot; in these situations) which allowed the drafter to have an accurate right angle at any point on the page quite quickly. These machines often included the ability to change the angle, thereby removing the need for the triangles as well.

In addition to the mastery of the mechanics of drawing lines, arcs and circles (and text) onto a piece of paper—with respect to the detailing of physical objects—the drafting effort requires a thorough understanding of geometry, trigonometry and spatial comprehension, and in all cases demands precision and accuracy, and attention to detail of high order.

Although drafting is sometimes accomplished by a project engineer, architect—or even by shop personnel such as a [[machinist]]—skilled drafters (and/or designers) usually accomplish the task and are always in demand to some level.

===Computer aided design===
{{Main|Computer-aided design}}

Today, the mechanics of the drafting task have largely been automated and accelerated through the use of [[Computer-aided design|computer-aided design]] systems (CAD).

There are two types of computer-aided design systems used for the production
of technical drawings&quot; [[2D computer graphics|two dimensions]] (&quot;2D&quot;) and [[3D computer graphics|three dimensions]] (&quot;3D&quot;).

2D CAD systems such as [[AutoCAD]] or [[MicroStation]] replace the paper drawing discipline. The lines, circles, arcs and curves are created within the software. It is down to the technical drawing skill of the user to produce the drawing. There is still much scope for error in the drawing when producing first and third angle orthographic projections, auxiliary projections and cross sections. A 2D CAD system is merely an electronic drawing board. Its greatest strength over direct to paper technical drawing is in the making of revisions. Whereas in a conventional hand drawn technical drawing, if a mistake is found, or a modification is required, a new drawing must be made from scratch, the 2D CAD system allows a copy of the original to be modified, saving considerable time. 2D CAD systems can be used to create plans for large projects such as buildings and aircraft but provide no way to check the various components will fit together.

[[Image:cad crank.jpg|thumb|left|View of a CAD model of a four-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], [[Straight engine|inline]] [[crankshaft]] with [[piston]]s]]
A 3D CAD system (such as [[KeyCreator]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], or [[SolidWorks]]) first produces the geometry of the part; the technical drawing comes from user defined views of that geometry. Any orthographic, projected or sectioned view is created by the software. There is no scope for error in the production of these views. The main scope for error comes in setting the parameter of first or third angle projection, and displaying the relevant symbol on the technical drawing. 3D CAD allows individual parts to be assembled together to represent the final product. Buildings, Aircraft, ships, and cars are modeled, assembled, and checked in 3D before technical drawings are released for manufacture.

Both 2D and 3D CAD systems can be used to produce technical drawings for any discipline. The various disciplines (electrical, electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc.) have industry recognized symbols to represent common components.

BS and ISO produce standards to show recommended practices but it is up to individuals to produce the drawings. There is no definitive standard for layout or style. The only standard across engineering workshop drawings is in the creation of orthographic projections and cross section views.

Drafting can represent [[2D computer graphics|two dimensions]] (&quot;2D&quot;) and [[3D computer graphics|three dimensions]] (&quot;3D&quot;) although the representation itself is always created in 2D (cf. [[Architectural model]]). Drafting is the integral communication of technical or engineering drawings and is the [[industrial arts]] sub-discipline that underlies all involved technical endeavors.

In representing complex, three-dimensional objects in two-dimensional drawings, the objects can be described by at least one view plus material thickness note, 2, 3 or as many views and sections that are required to show all features of object.

==Applications for technical drawing==
===Architecture===
[[File:Architect Anthony Murphy working on a kitchen renovation project in New Jersey.jpg|thumb|160px|To plan a renovation, this architect takes measurements, which he later enters into his [[computer-aided design]] software.]]
{{Main|Architectural drawing}}

The art and design that goes into making buildings is known as &quot;architecture&quot;. To communicate all aspects of the shape or design, detail drawings are used. In this field, the term  ''[[Plan (drawing)|plan]]'' is often used when referring to the full section view of these drawings as viewed from three feet above finished floor to show the locations of doorways, windows, stairwells, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferis, Alan; Madsen, David (2005), Architectural Drafting and Design (5th ed.), Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, ISBN 1-4018-6715-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Architectural drawings describe and document an architect's design.&lt;ref&gt;Goetsch et al. (2000) p. 792&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear left}}

===Engineering===
{{Main|Engineering drawing}}
{{See also|Mechanical engineering}}

Engineering can be a very broad term. It stems from the Latin ''ingenerare'', meaning &quot;to create&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, Dennis K; Sorby, Sheryl (2009), ''Visualization, Modeling, and Graphics for Engineering Design'' (1st ed.), Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, ISBN 1-4018-4249-6, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Because this could apply to everything that humans create, it is given a narrower definition in the context of technical drawing. Engineering drawings generally deal with mechanical engineered items, such as manufactured parts and equipment.

[[File:DIN 69893 hsk 63a drawing.png|thumb|210px|left|[[Engineering drawing]] of a [[machine tool]] part]]
Engineering drawings are usually created in accordance with standardized conventions for layout, nomenclature, interpretation, appearance (such as [[typeface]]s and line styles), size, etc.

Its purpose is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a product or a component. The end goal of an engineering drawing is to convey all the required information that will allow a manufacturer to produce that component.

===Technical illustration===
[[File:Drum set.svg|thumb|210px|[[Technical illustration|Illustration]] of a drum set]]

{{Main|Technical illustration}}

''Technical illustration'' is the use of [[illustration]] to visually communicate information of a technical nature. Technical illustrations can be component technical drawings or [[diagram]]s. The aim of technical illustration is &quot;to generate expressive [[image]]s that effectively convey certain [[information]] via the visual channel to the human observer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ViGr05&quot;&gt;Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gröller (2005). &quot;Smart Visibility in Visualization&quot;. In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The main purpose of technical illustration is to describe or explain these items to a more or less nontechnical audience. The visual image should be accurate in terms of dimensions and proportions, and should provide &quot;an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer’s interest and understanding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm www.industriegrafik.com The Role of the Technical Illustrator in Industry] webarticle, Last modified: Juni 15, 2002. Accessed 15 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viola (2005) &quot;illustrative techniques are often designed in a way that even a person with no technical understanding clearly understands the piece of art. The use of varying line widths to emphasize mass, proximity, and scale helped to make a simple line drawing more understandable to the lay person. Cross hatching, stippling, and other low abstraction techniques gave greater depth and dimension to the subject matter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ViGr05&quot;/&gt;

====Cutaway drawing====
[[File:1942 Nash Ambassador X-ray.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Cutaway drawing]] of the [[Nash 600]], an American car of the 1940s]]
{{Main|Cutaway drawing}}

A ''cutaway drawing'' is a technical illustration, in which part of the surface of a three-dimensional model is removed in order to show some of the model's interior in relation to its exterior.

The purpose of a cutaway drawing is to &quot;allow the viewer to have a look into an otherwise solid opaque object. Instead of letting the inner object shine through the surrounding surface, parts of outside object are simply removed. This produces a visual appearance as if someone had cutout a piece of the object or sliced it into parts. Cutaway illustrations avoid ambiguities with respect to spatial ordering, provide a sharp contrast between foreground and background objects, and facilitate a good understanding of spatial ordering&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWE03&quot;&gt;J.

==Technical drawings==
===Types of technical drawings===
The two types of technical drawings are based on [[graphical projection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g2000p3&quot;/&gt;  This is used to create an image of a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional surface.

====Two-dimensional representation====
Two-dimensional representation uses [[orthographic projection]] to create an image where only two of the three dimensions of the object are seen.

====Three-dimensional representation====
In a three-dimensional representation, also referred to as a pictorial, all three dimensions of an object are visible.

===Views===
====Multiview====
{{Main|Multiview orthographic projection}}
Multiview is a type of [[orthographic projection]]. There are two conventions for using multiview, first-angle and third-angle. In both cases, the front or main side of the object is the same. First-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they land. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90&amp;nbsp;degrees to the right. What is seen will be drawn to the right of the front side. Third-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they are. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90&amp;nbsp;degrees to the right. What is seen is actually the left side of the object and will be drawn to the left of the front side

====Section====
While multiview relates to external surfaces of an object, section views show an imaginary plane cut through an object. This is often useful to show voids in an object.

====Auxiliary====
Auxiliary views utilize an additional projection plane other than the common planes in a multiview. Since the features of an object need to show the true shape and size of the object, the projection plane must be parallel to the object surface. Therefore, any surface that is not in line with the three major axis needs its own projection plane to show the features correctly.

====Pattern====
Patterns, sometimes called developments, show the size and shape of a flat piece of material needed for later bending or folding into a three dimensional shape.&lt;ref&gt;Goetsch et al. (2000), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exploded====
{{Main|Exploded-view drawing}}
[[Image:Gear pump exploded.png|thumb|210px|[[Exploded-view drawing]] of a [[gear pump]]]]

An ''exploded-view drawing'' is a technical drawing of an object that shows the relationship or order of [[manufacturing|assembly]] of the various parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;&gt;[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (2005), [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/#drawing General Information Concerning Patents § 1.84 Standards for drawings] (Revised January 2005). Accessed 13 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the components of an object slightly separated by distance, or suspended in surrounding space in the case of a three-[[dimension]]al exploded diagram. An object is represented as if there had been a small controlled [[explosion]] emanating from the middle of the object, causing the object's parts to be separated relative distances away from their original locations.

An exploded view drawing (EVD) can show the intended assembly of mechanical or other parts. In mechanical systems usually the component closest to the center is assembled first, or is the main part in which the other parts get assembled. This drawing can also help to represent disassembly of parts, where the parts on the outside normally get removed first.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Brumbach, Jeffrey A. Clade (2003). ''Industrial Maintenance''. Cengage Learning, 2003

===Standards and conventions===

====Basic drafting paper sizes====
{{Main|Paper size}}

There have been many standard sizes of [[paper]] at different times and in different countries, but today most of the world uses the international standard (A4 and its siblings). North America uses its own sizes.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Patent drawing===
[[File:Wright brothers patent plans 1908.jpg|thumb|210px|The [[Wright brothers]]' [[patent drawing]]s for their aeroplane (1908)]]
{{Main|Patent drawing}}

The applicant for a [[patent]] will be required by [[law]] to furnish a [[drawing]] of the [[invention]] if or when the nature of the case requires a drawing to understand the invention with the job. This drawing must be filed with the application. This includes practically all inventions except [[wikt:composition|composition]]s of matter or [[Industrial process|process]]es, but a drawing may also be useful in the case of many processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt;

The drawing must show every feature of the invention [[specification|specified]] in the claims, and is required by the [[patent office]] rules to be in a particular form. The Office specifies the size of the sheet on which the drawing is made, the type of paper, the margins, and other details relating to the making of the drawing. The reason for specifying the standards in detail is that the drawings are printed and published in a uniform style when the patent issues, and the drawings must also be such that they can be readily understood by persons using the patent descriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;US PTO05&quot;/&gt;

===Sets of technical drawings===
====Working drawings for production====
[[Working drawing]]s are the set of technical drawings used during the manufacturing phase of a product.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph W. Liebing (1999). ''Architectural working drawings''. John Wiley and Sons, 1999. ISBN 0-471-34876-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, these include [[civil drawing]]s, [[architectural drawing]]s, [[structural drawing]]s, [[mechanical systems drawing]]s, [[electrical drawing]]s, and [[plumbing drawing]]s.

====Assembly drawings====
Assembly drawings show how different parts go together, identify those parts by number, and have a parts list, often referred to as a bill of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Goetsch et al. (2000), p. 613&lt;/ref&gt;  In a technical service manual, this type of drawing may be referred to as an [[exploded view drawing]] or diagram.
These parts may be used in engineering.

====As-fitted drawings====
Also called ''As-Built drawings'', or ''As-made drawings''. '''As-fitted drawings''' represent a record of the completed works, literally 'as fitted'. These are based upon the ''working drawings'' and updated to reflect any changes or alterations undertaken during construction or manufacture.

A '''medical illustration''' is a form of [[biological illustration]] that helps to record and disseminate medical, anatomical, and related knowledge.

==History==
Medical [[illustration]]s have been made possibly since the  [[History of medicine|beginning of medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;FM. Corl1, MR. Garland and EK. Fishman - ''Role of Computer Technology in Medical Illustration'' [http://www.ajronline.org/content/175/6/1519.full AJR December 2000 vol. 175 no. 6 1519-1524] Retrieved 2012-12-20&lt;/ref&gt; in any case for hundreds (or thousands) of years. Many illuminated manuscripts and Arabic scholarly treatises of the medieval period contained illustrations representing various anatomical systems (circulatory, nervous, urogenital), pathologies, or treatment methodologies. Many of these illustrations can look odd to modern eyes, since they reflect early reliance on classical scholarship (especially [[Galen]]) rather than direct observation, and the representation of internal structures can be fanciful. An early high-water mark was the 1542 CE publication of [[Andreas Vesalius]]'s ''[[De Humani Corporis Fabrica]] Libri Septum'', which contained more than 600 exquisite woodcut illustrations based on careful observation of human dissection.

As a profession, medical illustration has a more recent history. In the late 1890s, [[Max Brödel]], a talented artist from [[Leipzig]], was brought to The [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in Baltimore to illustrate for [[Harvey Cushing]], [[William Stewart Halsted|William Halsted]], [[Howard Atwood Kelly|Howard Kelly]], and other notable clinicians. In addition to being an extraordinary artist, he created new techniques, such as [[carbon dust]], that were especially suitable to his subject matter and then-current printing technologies. In 1911 he presided over the creation of the first academic department of medical illustration, which continues to this day. His graduates spread out across the world, and founded a number of the academic programs listed below under &quot;Education&quot;.

Notable medical illustrators include [[Max Brödel]] and Dr. [[Frank H. Netter]]. For an online inventory of scientific illustrators including currently already more than 1000 medical illustrators active 1450-1950 and specializing in anatomy, dermatology and embryology, see the [http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi/ Stuttgart Database of Scientific Illustrators 1450-1950 (DSI)]

Medical illustration is used in the [[history of medicine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Matuk2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration |author=Camillia Matuk |journal=Journal of Biocommunication |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2006 |url=http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf |pmid= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profession==
Medical illustrators not only produce such material but can also function as consultants and administrators within the field of [[Biocommunication (science)|biocommunication]]. A certified medical illustrator continues to obtain extensive training in [[medicine]], [[science]], and [[art]] techniques throughout his or her career.

The [[Association of Medical Illustrators]] is an international organization founded in 1945, and incorporated in Illinois. Its members are primarily artists who create material designed to facilitate the recording and dissemination of medical and bioscientific knowledge through visual communication media. Members are involved not only in the creation of such material, but also serve in consultant, advisory, educational and administrative capacities in all aspects of bioscientific communications and related areas of visual education.

The professional objectives of the AMI are to promote the study and advancement of medical illustration and allied fields of visual communication, and to promote understanding and cooperation with the medical profession and related health science professions.

The AMI publishes an annual [[Medical Illustration Source Book]] which is distributed to creative and marketing professionals that regularly hire medical/scientific image makers for editorial, publishing, educational and advertising projects. There is a companion Source Book with searchable illustration, animation and multimedia portfolios from hundreds of artists in the field.

The obvious abilities necessary are to be able to visualize the subject-matter, some degree of originality in style of drawing and the refined skill of colour discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.education.nih.gov/lifeworks.nsf/alphabetical+list/Medical+Illustrator?OpenDocument&amp;ShowTab=All&amp; nih.gov] Retrieved 2012-12-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Most medical illustrators in the profession have a master's degree from an accredited graduate program in medical illustration or another advanced degree in either science or the arts. The [[Association of Medical Illustrators]] is a sponsor member of CAAHEP (Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs), the organization that grants accreditation to the graduate programs in medical illustration upon recommendation of ARC-MI (Accreditation Review Committee for the Medical Illustrator) which is a standing committee of the AMI and a Committee on Accreditation of CAAHEP. Currently there are  five accredited Programs in North America:

The Department of Art as Applied to Medicine on the East Baltimore Campus of the world famous [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions]] was the first program of its kind in the world. Endowed in 1911, the program has been in existence for over 90 years. In 1959, the [[Johns Hopkins University]] approved a two-year graduate program leading to the University-wide degree of Master of Arts in Medical and Biological Illustration. The academic calendar, faculty and student affairs are administered by The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The program has been fully accredited since 1970, currently accredited by the [[Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs]] (CAAHEP). The current Chair and Director of the program is Gary P. Lees, MS, CMI.

The Biomedical Visualization Program at the [[University of Illinois]] at Chicago's College of Applied Health Sciences is the second oldest school of medical illustration in the western hemisphere, founded in 1921 by Thomas Smith Jones (Jones also was co-founder of the [[Association of Medical Illustrators]]). The UIC program is located in the national healthcare and pharmaceutical hub of Chicago, and offers a market-based curriculum that includes the highest ends of technology (including the renowned Virtual Reality Medical Laboratory and a rigorous animation curriculum). Biomedical Visualization is located on the UIC Medical Center campus, home of the largest medical school in the United States. The UIC program blends the more traditional aspects of medical illustration and the emerging markets of digital, pharmaceutical, and &quot;edutainment&quot; industries. UIC also offers an extensive study in the field of anaplastology (facial and somatic prosthetics), medical sculpture, and an international internship program is available. A two-year Master of Science (MS) in Biomedical Visualization degree is awarded, and the program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP).

The Medical Illustration Graduate Program  of the [[Medical College of Georgia]], Augusta is fully accredited by (CAAHEP). Graduates receive a Master of Science in Medical Illustration. The first Master of Science degree in Medical Illustration at MCG was awarded in 1951. The program emphasizes anatomical and surgical illustration for print and electronic publication, as well as for projection and broadcast distribution. Because of the importance of good drawing skills, the students learn a variety of traditional illustration techniques during the first year. In addition, computer technologies and digital techniques, used to prepare both vector and raster images for print and motion media, are well and extensively integrated into the curriculum.

The Biomedical Communications Program at the [[University of Toronto]]. This program was begun in 1945 by Maria Wishart, a student of [[Max Brödel]]'s. Faculty and graduates of the program contributed the drawings for Grant's Atlas of Anatomy, a renowned guide to dissection, structure, and function for medical students. The current two-year professional Master's program, offered through the Institute of Medical Science, emphasizes a research-based approach to the creation and evaluation of visual material for health promotion, medical education, and the process of scientific discovery.

The Biomedical Communication Graduate Program at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] at Dallas. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center was the first school in the world to offer a graduate degree in medical illustration in 1945. Lewis Boyd Waters, who studied under Max Brodel at Johns Hopkins in the 1920s, was a founding member of the medical school and was responsible for starting the master's program.  Professor Waters died in 1969 and was later succeeded by several of his students who continued and expanded the program.  The current program is offered through the Department of Biomedical Communications, and courses are taught by faculty of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and Southwestern Allied Health Sciences School. The program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs. It is designed to be an interdisciplinary program that provides opportunities for development of the skills and knowledge needed in the application of communications arts and technology to the health sciences.

==Technique==
Medical illustrators create medical illustrations using traditional and digital techniques which can appear in medical textbooks, medical advertisements, professional journals, instructional videotapes and films, animations, web-based media, computer-assisted learning programs, exhibits, lecture presentations, general magazines and television. Although much medical illustration is designed for print or presentation media, medical illustrators also work in three dimensions, creating anatomical teaching models, [[virtual patient|patient simulators]], and [[facial prosthetics]].

The traditional tools of medical illustration are slowly being replaced and supplemented by a range of unique modern artistic practices.  Three-dimensional renders and endoscopic cameras are replacing carbon dust and cadavers.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}
[[Image:Reglas.svg|thumb|250px|triangle, set square]]

A '''set square''' or '''triangle''' ([[American English]]) is an object used in engineering and [[technical drawing]], with the aim of providing a [[straightedge]] at a [[right angle]] or other particular planar angle to a [[:wikt:baseline|baseline]].

The most simple form of set square is a triangular piece of transparent [[plastic]] (or formerly of polished wood) with the centre removed. More commonly the set square bears the markings of a [[ruler]] and a half circle [[protractor]]. The outer edges are typically [[bevel]]led.  These set squares come in two usual forms, both [[right triangle]]s: one with 90-45-45 degree angles, the other with 30-60-90 degree angles.  Combining the two forms by placing the hypotenuses together will also yield 15° and 75° angles.  They are often purchased in packs with [[protractor]]s and [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]].

Less commonly found is the adjustable set square.  Here, the body of the object is cut in half and rejoined with a [[hinge]] marked with angles.  Adjustment to the marked angle will produce any desired angle up to a maximum of 180°.

[[File:Set square Geodreieck.svg|thumb|Geodreieck]]
In many European countries, the most common form of set square combines a 90-45-45 triangle with a protractor into a single tool made of clear plastic. Named &quot;Geodreieck&quot; (German for &quot;geometry triangle&quot;), it was originally developed and trademarked&lt;!-- R337 300 --&gt; by the German manufacturer ''Aristo-Instrumente Dennert KG'' (now ''GEOtec Zeichen- und Kunststofftechnik GmbH'') in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aristo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Unternehmen / Geschichte | publisher=GEOtec Zeichen- und Kunststofftechnik GmbH | language=German | date=2013 | url=http://www.aristo.at/go/unternehmen | accessdate=2015-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''worm's-eye view''' is a [[Perspective (visual)|view]] of an object from below, as though the [[observation|observer]] were a [[earthworm|worm]]; the opposite of a [[bird's-eye view]].
A worm's eye view is used commonly for third perspective, with one vanishing point on top, one on the left, and one on the right.

It can be used to look up to something to make an object look tall, strong, and mighty.
